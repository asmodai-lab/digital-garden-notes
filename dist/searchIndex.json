		"content": "Obsidian is a note-taking app which is somewhat similar to Notion and OneNote, but with many more features. While I never used Notion for a long time, I find Obsidian easier to navigate and with more personalisation.\nI do various things with Obsidian — note-taking, essay planning, mind-mapping, planning my day, keeping track of what I need to do, etc. There is an insane amount of things you can do with Obsidian, and it is up to you whether or not you do those things.\nAnyway, let's start with the very basics.\nYou can make a note using the bar on the top left, or use Ctrl+N (or Command/Cmnd, for Macs. If I say Ctrl from now on, assume I also mean Command.)\nMost importantly, you can link notes together by using double square brackets - [[]] - like that but with text in the middle.) You can both link to existing notes by typing in a note's title (which automatically searches your vault to show you which notes you could be asking to link to) or create a note by typing in a title and clicking the link.\n\nYou know the Wikipedia system? Where there are hyperlinks here there and everywhere linking between articles? This is that. Cool, right?\n\n[!warning] Types of links\nThere are two kinds of links to a note: forwards and backwards. Forwards is a link that is in the current note going outwards to another note, and backwards links are links going into the current note from another note. They are, unfortunately, categorised separately when searching your vault using properties. You can see the forwards and backwards links in two of the tabs on the top right hand side — they should look like linked chains with an arrow.\n\nFinally, you need to know the command Ctrl+P. This opens the command menu, which is where you can do anything — creating new notes, bases, canvases, opening certain views, plus any commands from any plugins, etcetera.\nTyping in notes\nYou can type in these notes as usual, although there are a few shortcuts that are used in markdown format (the format that these notes are in) to use the base program.\n\nYou can, of course, use the Editing Toolbar plugin to have a word-esque toolbar to use. I personally find the hotkeys easier, though.\n\nThe basic hotkeys are as follows:\n\nCtrl+B / two asterisks on both sides of any text-&gt; Bold text\nCtrl+I / one asterisk on both sides of any text -&gt; Italic text\nTwo equals {=} on both sides of any text -&gt; highlighter\nusing a dash {-} and then space to start a list\n\nlike this\n\nusing a number, then period, then space to start an automatic numbered list (see the current example)\nusing {&gt;} to indent text slightly\n\nLike this\n\nusing Tab to indent both text and lists\n\nlike this\n\nUsing hashtags plus a space before text to indicate a Header — one hashtag for most important, down to 6 hashtags for least\n\nYou can also do all of this by right-clicking and using the menu that appears.\nAlso in the menu is the table function — i.e. just a normal table, the rule function-\n\n-which looks like the line above, and the callout function, which can create cool blocks-\n\n[!tip] Cool block\nLike this!\n\nThat's about it for inbuilt text features. There are a few plugins that I would recommend, but we'll get onto that in the Plugins section.\n\n[!info]\nNote that Obsidian doesn't have an automatic spell-checker. This goes for capital letters at the start of sentences, too! It is, however, very very easy to get a spellchecker — which I will be talking about in the Plugins section.\n\nOther inbuilt features of Obsidian\nGraph view\nGraph view is where linking notes comes into play! It's a fun way of looking at the links between your notes and finding notes.\nHere's a screenshot of my current graph view:\n\nEvery single dot is a note. Every single line is a link.\nThere are a few other things you can do with graph view — messing around with the forces, colouring the dots based on properties that the note has — but the know-how gets explained later, so I'll leave it for now.\nAnd by later, I mean now!\nTags and properties\nThis is your second way of sorting notes, other than links (and the file repository on the left, but do I really need to explain how to use that?). It's incredibly useful and not complicated at all.\nEssentially, each note has a list of properties. You can add to these and change these as you like. These properties include (but are not limited to):\n\nthe file name\nthe folder that it is in\nfile links (forwards and backwards are separate, remember?)\ncreated time\nmodified time\nfile path (how does it link to your 'home note' — i.e. the origin note)\nand tags!\n\nYou can change these using the properties view — which is an inbuilt plugin (you only have to turn it on from settings) or for changing tags, you can just type in the tag. It's like, so #cool &lt;-(literally like that.)\n\nYou can also use properties view to change tags. You can find properties view in the 'core plugins' section of settings and then you can find the menu under the info button in the top-right bar.\n\nYou can search your notes by using these tags or group notes together by using these tags from graph view, if you just don't want to use links.\n\nI use it to categorise my notes into major lessons, minor lessons, resources, essay plans, and various other things. It makes it easier to find a specific note if I am looking for it.\n\nThis leads well into-\nCategorizing and searching notes\nThis is done using the inbuilt plugin 'Bases' — which you can find and activate in the same way as you found Properties View. It should already be enabled, but who knows.\nThis is one of my bases:\n\nAs you can see, bases contain all of your notes and are very searchable and customisable. Everything except the 'file name' property is something I put in through the 'properties' menu which you can see on the top right of the image.\nYou can search your notes in various ways. You can query by including, excluding, containing, does not contain, and apply these to the file properties. Here, I searched by the 'debates' tag — but if I wanted to only have Politics notes, I can use the 'does not contain' query looking into the 'folder' property and write 'philosophy' to exclude all philosophy notes.\n\nAlthough, note that other than searching for categories of notes, it's most useful for editing the properties of categories of notes. You see those tick-boxes under 'dg-publish'? Those are what decides if certain notes go onto my site or not. And I can do it in a single click! No searching through each and every note's properties view!\n\nYes, I will give a basic explanation of how to publish notes online for free.\n\n[!important] On graph view\nYou remember graph view? Using properties is how I colour the nodes in graph view — you can colour them in the graph view menu using properties and then assigning a colour to nodes with a certain property.\n\nFinally,\nCanvas\nCanvas is the final core plugin which needs an explanation. It's essentially just a mindmap.\nHere's one I made earlier-\n\nIt's zoomed out, so you can't see the text, but you see what it is, right? It's quite useful — especially in understanding lines of argument and forcing you to make links between ideas. It's good for redo-ing messy notes from a lesson — it helps in understanding and remembering the content by making you interact with your notes properly.\nYou won't see it in this website though, because it's an incompatible format, and these were made before I started working on this website. Nowadays, I use (and you will see) the Excalidraw plugin which is similar in it's features, but looks quite different — and it's in a compatible format for posting.\nTo be continued...",

Jesus acted in the city of man; why shouldn't we?\nThere is only one example of the Bible separating the city of man and God- 'My kingdom is not of this world.' That, however, does not discourage the idea that we should act on Earth in the image of Christ, just that heaven is above/better than Earth.\n\nSome argue that Liberation theology misunderstands the Kingdom of God by misunderstanding the separation of the cities of man and God. A weak point in support of this is proposed by Augustine: that since the city of man is inherently sinful and doomed to fail, we should not involve ourselves with it- i.e. in acting in a political manner and being involved in the state, Liberation Theology is acting in an un-christian manner. A stronger point against this is that Augustine's views have no basis in the Bible. Jesus himself acted in such a way that would fit Augustine's own definition of acting in the city of man- he was an inherently political figure who not only did political acts, but encouraged those around him to do so: by spreading his message (&quot;Have you heard the good news/gospel?&quot;) and behaviours. To say that Christians should not be involved in the city of man is a viewpoint with no basis in the Bible- to go so far as the evidence going against the ideas of the separation of the city of man and God. Overall, Liberation Theology does not misunderstand the Kingdom of God as Augustine would argue- because Augustine's viewpoint that one should not act politically is an idea that is entirely his own, with basis in the Bible that disproves his own views- and so it cannot be a successful argument for Liberation Theology misunderstanding Christianity.",

		"content": "#homework #debates\n\nSpeech (refined)\nUltimately, if Liberation theology aligned too closely with Marxism, it would compromise christian faith. However, it does not align too closely with Marxism.\nThese two are fundamentally different ideas- even in their own definitions. Marxism is a political system, which expressed methods of overthrowing and then running a country. In comparison, Liberation Theology is just an ideology- an ethics system: but not one that is comprehensive or consistent across the people who propose it. Sure, it's core ideology: that society causes sin (aka structural sin) and that one must tackle these problems at the core is one taken from Marxism. But to say that these ideas are closely intertwined is ignorant.\nTo pretend that LT is incredibly closely aligned with Marxism ignores the major proponents of LT. Both Boff and Gutierrez warn against adopting all of Marx's ideas- Boff says 'that marx is a useful companion on the way, but there is only one teacher; jesus christ.'\nThe first point brought up by critics of Liberation theology is that the church should not be political. If you encounter anyone who brings up this point, you should first ask if they have read the Bible, and second if they have been living under a rock.\nBoth Jesus Christ and the church have been and are political. It is fundamental to their nature- no matter how you think about politics. Jesus told the rich that, unlike the poor who were blessed, they would face woes. He criticised the King as a fox. He spoke harsh words to leaders of the nations when they were uncaring of the needy. He rode into Jerusalem on a donkey as a way of declaring himself king. The character of Jesus Christ is inescapably political. Just because he was never political as in involving himself in a political party, does not in any way mean that he wasn't political.\nThen, some may argue that the church itself shouldn't be political- because it has set precedent to do so. If you haven't already asked if the proponent has been living under a rock, please do so now.\nThe church has been political in England for a long, long time.\nThe welfare system, (part of which you may know as the NHS- but containing most of the social care we know today) was set up by a man named William Beveridge, who was friends with the at the time Archbishop William Temple.\nThey reimagined post war Britain with the ideals of God in mind, and through that have saved and improved the lived of millions.\nIf you want a more recent example- how about the previous Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby- who has explicitly written that the church should get involved in politics. In an article he wrote in 2018, he says:\n&quot;There will be great changes in our country through technology and science, through changes abroad and at home. We may base change in good values. We may just let things take their course.\nBut if it’s the latter, then the consequences for the poor, the sick and those on the margins will be dire. Our pride will be diminished, and our contribution to the world stifled.&quot;\nSo yes, the church should be and is political- and this idea, reminiscent of Liberation Theology (which comes from Marxism)- cannot be argued in any way shape or form to compromise christian faith.\nOn the other hand, some have argued that Liberation theology compromises Christianity by being too closely aligned with action. Richard McBrien argues that liberation theology is so concerned about action that it has not paid sufficient attention to christian theology. In starting from action it cannot determine which actions might be right or wrong.\nI.e. one should be more focussed on prayer than action.\nAgain, one should ask any proponent of this question if they have read the bible, and if they say yes, ask if they a) are very sure, and b) did they do it with their eyes open? Does jesus spend the majority of his time praying? Does he? Really? I rest my case.\nThen, some flip that and say that Liberation theology is too focussed on structural sin rather than individual sin- which is not in the path of Jesus. Kloppenburg argues that jesus reached into people's personal lives and spoke of the individual coming back to God through forgiveness- and that ultimately, it is only God that brings salvation.\nThis argument is, frankly, baffling. Jesus called for people to follow in his path, of kindness and uplifting the meek. To argue that because only God can bring large-scale salvation- we should not try and do that, is a lazy, evil viewpoint. To decide to not try and help people on a systemic scale because it will\n\nUnrefined\n'Laws are threats by the dominant socioeconomic power in any given region [...] the police are just an occupying army. '\n&quot;When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.&quot; -Brazilian Archbishop Camara\nWas it not political when Jesus rallied against the occupying romans? Was it not political\nJustin welby's article about being political because that is how we make a better world for our children. https://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/church-gets-involved-politics-because-thats-what-jesus-did\nHe was never party political. No wing of politics – left or right – can claim God as being on its side.\nBut Jesus was highly political. He told the rich that, unlike the poor who were blessed, they would face woes. He criticised the King as a fox. He spoke harsh words to leaders of the nations when they were uncaring of the needy.\nHe did this because God cares for those in need and expects those who claim to act in his name to do the same. That means action - and words.\n1942 Archbishop William Temple was old friends with William Beveridge, a top civil servant and another Christian, who wrote his great report that designed the welfare system, the health service and much of what we now take for granted in social care. They were friends with R.H. Tawney, a social philosopher, and again a Christian.\nDrawing on Christian understandings of justice, generosity and human dignity, they described the kind of country that they felt reflected God’s values better.\nThere will be great changes in our country through technology and science, through changes abroad and at home. We may base change in good values. We may just let things take their course.\nBut if it’s the latter, then the consequences for the poor, the sick and those on the margins will be dire. Our pride will be diminished, and our contribution to the world stifled.\nIf we all take part in forming our values, if we base them in what is good and precious in our heritage, then our future can be better than our past. Our children and grandchildren can remember us as a generation that gave them hope and purpose.\nFor me, that is worth risking one’s head for. It justifies the church not only speaking about Jesus Christ, but also, like him, calling for – as well as working for – the society that God calls us to pursue.\n\nStructure\n\nsummary of my line of argument: Yes, if Liberation theology aligned too closely with Marxism, it would compromise christian faith, but in the manner it aligns in now it does not compromise christian faith, but complement it.\nShould the church even be political?\n\nShould the church focus on one individual group? Isn't that unfair?\n\nWhat about spiritual poverty?\n\nShouldn't the church focus on spirituality/theology rather than action?\nStructural sin\n\nDoes structural sin exist? (yes)\nshould the church tackle it?\nhow does liberation theology suggest we tackle it? How does it differ from Marxism?\n\nViolence\n\nShould the church be violent in it's aims to do liberation theology (no)\nhowever, political violence does not count\n\nand Jesus was politically violent. be honest with yourselves.",

This was completely ignored by the Trump administration. They have also ignored orders not to send troops to Chicago.\nWhile the courts used to support habeas corpus and rights for immigrants, in more recent years these have been ignored by the Trump administration- demonstrating that the SC has very little power to enforce it's decisions.\n\nBostock v Clayton county (2020)- or the upholding of the ACA, or Trump v Casa Inc. (First- upholds rights, second and third uphold government actions. )\nFederalism\nOverall upholds federalism on more minor laws. such as Dobbs v Jackson, United States v Skremetti, and Rucho v Common cause, and Murphy v NCAA.\nWhile the court has had some major rulings that directly create/uphold policy nationwide, these examples are generally rare, and mostly limited to constitutional rights. On anything not in the constitution, the SC almost always gives power to the states.\n\nThe court's independence means it is functionally immune to political pressure. The SC has gone against Trump many times- such as ordering that $2 billion in foreign aid be unfrozen, or Bostock v Clayton county (2020)\nPoliticisation\nThe conservative balance of the court has clearly led to more decisions in Trump's favour, making it weaker in its partisanship. For example- Trump v CASA inc., Trump v Hawaii, and Trump v United States all being ruled in his favour.\nWhile the SC can go against Trump, it often doesn't. Of course, this can change after justices retire/die, but this will take a while, and will have a strong affect on american politics for at least 2 decades being a republican SC majority.\n\nThe court's decisions tend to be based on legal principles (Dobbs v Jackson) rather than politics. Also, ~50% of decisions are 9-0 or 8-1, despite the political split.\nJudicial activism\nThe court shows willingness to interfere in controversial political areas, such as in United states v. Skrmetti, claiming it was a matter of state authority despite claims that it went against equal protection rights.\nOverall, if judicial activism was more prevalent, one would expect less court decisions to be per curiam or close to. However, recent events- such as Justice Clarence Thomas' signalling to revisit Obergefell v Hodges, demonstrates that these judges are more political than previous.",

Polls say that political participation is highest among the upper classes and anyone above the age of 25. The voices that are heard aren't equal and so politicians target those who are most likely to vote- so not young people. If we want things to get better, we want to force politicians to truly represent everyone\n\nMandatory voting encourages political awareness\n\nMandatory voting increases turnout among underrepresented groups- such as the youth, POC, and the working class.\n\nHow do you enforce compulsory voting?

They aren't allowed to get married, buy alcohol or cigarettes, or leave school.\nThat doesn't mean that they don't deserve a say in society. Also, they can join the army, have sex, and pay taxes. also, imposing adult responsibilities is not a right (bull)\nUltimately, it is true that teens cannot exercise full adult responsibility. This, however, is unrelated to if they should have the right to vote.\n\n16-year-olds will end up just voting as an extension of their parents- which means the groups in society who have kids will be overrepresented in the electorate.\nVoting is secret. While yes, many will vote as an extension of their parents- so do many people vote as an extension of their family/friends. Nobody can be coerced into voting in a certain manner. Also, citizenship lessons.\nJust because one will vote irresponsibly, does not take away the fact they should have the right to vote. Even shitheads deserve rights.\n\n16-year-olds can pay taxes- many have part-time jobs, and that means they contribute to society- therefore, they should have a say in how their money is being spent.\nPaying taxes is not a precursor to voting. Also, most 16-year-olds don't earn enough money to pay taxes anyway. This doesn't apply to the majority.\nThe fact that some do- even a minority- is enough. Plus- some adults don't pay taxes, and they can vote. Why not 16-year-olds?\n\nteens don't have the necessary life experience to make proper decisions. Voter turnout amongst 18-24s is typically under 50%. Also, 18s are significantly more likely to be active members of society.\nThe same could be said for 18s, though. Policy decisions now will affect teens much more than adults- like the environment. They should have a say in their future.\nJust because turnout is low, and that will decrease legitimacy- does not mean that they don't deserve the right to vote. Remember: even shitheads have rights.\n\nThere isn't only one way (voting) to be involved in politics. Joining a pressure group or political party, signing a petition, or contacting your local MP are actions that all are capable of.\nThis doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to vote.",

		"content": "#debates\n\nPolitical\nThemes\nJudicial\nEvaluation\n\nThe appointment process is inherently political since the nominees are from the sitting President- who appoints judges based on ideology. This is clear in that Trump appointed three justices and the SC swung right in it's decision making.\nPolitical pressure\nThe position is designed to be independent- as judges are appointed for life and not obviously venerable to political pressure. The current SC has voted against Trump multiple times (ordering the release of federal aid, ordering troops to withdraw from Chicago.)\nWhile judges don't face political pressure, this doesn't mean that they cannot choose to be political.\n\nThe SC has been more political in the last half-decade: overturning Roe v. Wade with Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health, or the many cases ruled in Trump's favour (Trump v CASA/United States/Hawaii), or in United states v. Skremetti, upholding Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors. They have clearly chosen to be more political in recent years.\nIdeologies\nJudges practice judicial restraint, and choose not to interfere in political matters. This is clear in ~50% of decisions being per curiam or 8-1, which wouldn't be expected if the judges were acting politically. They often use stare decisis or judge based on precedent- such as in Bostock v Clayton County: extending civil rights protections to Queer employees based on the Civil Rights Act- or in June Medical services v. Russo (2020)- which struck down an anti-abortion Louisiana law.\nIf this was 2015, it could be argued that the SC do practice Judicial Restraint. However, they have clearly become more political in recent years- going so far as Justice Clarence Thomas signalling that they would re-look over Obergefell v Hodges.\n\nBecause they directly affect other branches, it's impossible for them not to be political. Either ruling on Trump v. United States would have unavoidably and significantly affected the relationship between the white house and congress- which are inherently political branches.\nRelationships between branches\nThe SC rules only on the constitution, and any affect they have on the branches of government is coincidental. They make decisions not based on public opinion- such as in Admissions v Harvard (2023), in which their ruling was very unpopular. Or in California v Texas, which upheld Obamacare, despite it being a right-leaning court.\nWhile one can point to exceptions upon exceptions of the SC being unbiased, the reality is that the court is inherently political, no matter the leaning, because it affects political institutions. This is unavoidable, no matter how partisan they are.",

		"content": "#debates\n\nGood thing\nBad thing\nMini-conclusions\n\nVoter choice and democracy\nVoters are given a choice of president rather than only the party doing it. Voters can choose from a range of competing policies and ideologies within a political party.\nVoting in different states on different dates means voters in earlier states have a much greater level of influence. -unbound delagates are free to vote however they want, regardless of public opinion.\nOverall, it's clear that primaries are a bad thing for voter choice and democracy- because although they can vote for their president, in reality very few Americans will be able to affect the choice of candidate properly, because of primaries taking place on different days.\n\nvoter education and participation\nThroughout the primaries, issues with the candidate get aired. This means that the strongest candidate wins, and then has better chance of winning the election. - People develop better awareness of policies and issues. Then, because people are more aware, they are more likely to vote and vote effectively.\nClosed primaries restrict participation. Voting in different states on different dates means voters in late states are often left unable to vote.\nOverall, it's clear that primaries are a good thing for voter education and participation, because it directly involves them in the process and brings it to state-wide attention- and the higher awareness means that people are more likely to vote, increasing participation.\n\nbenefit for parties\nprimaries put candidates to the test in real elections. This helps the party select a candidate with the proven ability to win elections. Personal issues and political concerns can be dealt with during this time.\nThe eventual winner might be politically damaged by the process. Primaries do damage to a party by exposing infighting.\nOverall, it's clear that primaries benefit parties- because it brings their policies and personalities to national attention- and the winner does have a proven ability to persuade people to vote for them.\n\nIn conclusion, primaries play a negative role in US democracy to a small extent- because although it benefits parties by making sure their candidate is strong on the national stage, and it increases the political awareness in the general public- ultimately these don't matter in the face of the unfairness in the process. Having increased awareness or a better candidate does not matter if the later states have significantly less say in the candidate- sometimes even being functionally worthless if the candidate becomes presumptive before the later states have even voted.\nVarious evidence\no In the 2024 Republican primaries prominent candidates Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy dropped out after Iowa, the first state to vote. DeSantis, one of the favourites to win the whole primary process, dropped out after coming second to Trump. Voters in Iowa had greater levels of choice (four candidates) than voters in later states who only had a choice of Trump and moderate Republican Nikki Haley. This political inequality contradicts the basic principles of democracy.\no In 2016 the Republican establishment would almost certainly have chosen an established insider such as Ted Cruz or Jeb Bush. The primaries instead led to a clear winner in Trump who was arguably better equipped to win the presidency for the Republicans than either of the former candidates. The primaries quickly showed that whilst Bush has huge fund-raising capacity he lacked resonance with voters.\no Whilst Bush defeated McCain in a closely fought primary race in 2000, McCain's policy of campaign finance reform gained attention and popularity and was passed into law.",

		"url":"/essay-plans/politics-essay-plans/significance-of-parties-in-congress/",
		"content": "Examine the extent to which political parties are significant in congress.\nConclusion:\nOverall, parties have a significant effect on Congress because of member's reliance on parties to get elected due to an overwhelming amount of 'safe seats', meaning most must follow party leadership and decisions in order to keep their seats. This is supported by the unitary nature of the parties — which demonstrates that members will vote on party lines, especially when necessary, such as in both of Trump's impeachment charge votes. In the face of this, any individual member's power — whilst significant — cannot compare in the face of a unitary party, of which is necessary to pass legislation in the partisan american political system.\n\nSignificant\nTheme\nInsignificant\nEvaluation\n\nParty disciple is still evident. Despite overwhelming pressure to release the Epstein files, only 4 republicans defected. A large number of 'Never Trumpers' Republicans fell in line with Trump policies — such as tax cuts.\nUnity\nInternal factionalisation means that party unity is weakened. After the Jan 6th riots, 10 House Republicans voted to impeach Trump. Some Republicans have voted for the release of the Epstein files — or been publically against Trump (MTG)\nParties are incredibly unitary on controversial issues — such as on Trump's impeachment charges in 2019 and 2021, party lines were largely adhered to, demonstrating that on more controversial issues, parties will be unitary and so will have more effect.\n\nOne member voting against a legislative agenda won't work: it's necessary for parties to vote in unison to block or pass bills because of the often close majorities in house and senate.\nIndividual power\nIndividual members can have more power. Senator Joe Manchin had a pivotal role in the Biden agenda, such as blocking parts of the Build Back Better plan in 2021.\nWhile individual members often don't have power, the existence of the few that do and their power in shaping agenda and law demonstrates that an individual's power matters more than the party.\n\nParties still play a crucial role in candidate success. Most seats are safe seats for one party — that there are only 7 swing states in the USA, the rest are 'safe seats' and very rarely change, demonstrating that party loyalty is more important than candidate's qualifications. In 2024, only 17/435 house seats flipped party.\nLoyalty in elections\nParty loyalties are weak because of the constitutional separation of powers, and Parties don't provide many resources insofar as fighting campaigns, or finances. Many political adverts don't even mention the name of the candidate's party at all. Many news stations focus on individuals — like AOC or Mamdani.\nWhile candidates do campaign on individual platforms, the existence of safe seats demonstrates that people in elections mostly vote on party lines, not on if they like the candidate. Take Gavin Newsome, the Democratic governor of California, who before 2025 was incredibly unpopular within California but still was governor.\n\nThe President still has incredible power of persuasion — many of Trump's endorsements in 2022 largely secured nomination due to his influence. The ability of the President to endorse or attack candidates overrides any local importance.\nLocal politics\nPolitics is often local. Congress members have a much deeper connection to their constituencies because they don't rely on party affiliation to get elected — congress members are more aware of how their constituents will react to their voting record (which is made very public) than the leader of their party.\nSenators are more likely to have their voting record get more attention, but they are only elected every 6 years — which leaves a long time for constituents to forget individual votes. However, many Republican senators have fallen in line with Trump despite not agreeing with him, partly due to Trump's popularity, especially in their own Republican constituencies.",

		"content": "Link to the website\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resource/correcting-caricatures-women-and-bible-translation/\nTransliterated article\nWhen lecturing on women and Bible translation, I often see people Google facts they’ve never heard before. Few know Paula (347–404) led one of the great translation efforts—the Latin Vulgate. Nearly invisible in its history, Paula purchased the ancient manuscripts, guided the translator teams, and made linguistic edits. Jerome—her colleague on this project—acknowledged her leadership and so should we.\nOther women translators include Julia Evelina Smith (1792–1886), Louise Swanton Belloc (1796–1881), Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815–1902), and Pandita Ramabai (1858–1922)—who led the first all-women Bible effort, from translation to printing, binding, and distribution. The first woman to lead a denomination, Helen Barrett Montgomery (1861–1934) produced the Centenary Bible, citing doctor-missionary, anti-trafficking activist, and biblical scholar Katharine Bushnell (1855–1946).\nAfter decades of anti-trafficking advocacy that included confronting Christian men for their impunity and collusion in abusing women, Bushnell was compelled to address ways Scripture was used to view women as lesser than men. Theologically astute, she insisted that a correct interpretation as it relates to “women status” should be assigned in the same manner as “man’s status, [based] on the atonement of Jesus Christ.”1\nExposing biblical misrepresentations, Bushnell’s groundbreaking book, God’s Word to Women, shows how Scripture has been weaponized to demean women and fuel their abuse. Like other female translators, Bushnell considered the impact of accuracy in translation on women. Yet she was the first translator to critique every passage addressing women. To see how unjust some translators’ choices have been, here are a few significant examples from Bushnell’s God’s Word to Women.\nBeginning in Genesis, Bushnell insisted the text stresses not Eve’s failures and need of male authority, but their shared dignity and authority, Genesis 1:26–29. She challenged translating tsela as rib since (42 times in Scripture) it’s translated as “side” to evoke a mitosis process—of one whole organism becoming two complete organisms. “Side” is more accurate and dignifying to women.\nEqually, Bushnell noted how the word chayil, used over 200 times as “strength, force, or capacity,” is translated as “virtue” or “chastity” when referring to a woman.2 Likewise, teshuqah was translated as “lust” rather than “desire” in Genesis 3:16: “Your lust will be for your husband, and he will rule over you,” insinuating women are sensual and corrupt—a trend Bushnell also found in researching New Testament passages.\nConsider how kosmios was rendered “well-ordered” for men but “modest or pure” for women in 1 Timothy 2:9. Similarly, hagnos is translated as “holy” for men, but “pure” for women in  Titus 2:4–5.3  Tragically, the parable holding men and women to the same sexual ethic—the woman caught in adultery (John 7:53–8:11)—was missing in several translations, including Bushnell’s 1880 Chinese Bible and also key Syriac and Coptic manuscripts.⁴\nFor Bushnell, each of these examples of translation bias (and others noted in her book) may be “straws,” but “they all point in the same direction.”⁵  To depict women as innately immoral and lesser-than leads to immoral actions toward them.\nSo while translators depicted women as immoral and promiscuous, Bushnell’s systematic examination of Bible passages that address women elevated their redemption. Through Calvary, all receive a Christ-identity and Gospel purpose—to lead with spiritual authority as Christ’s new creation, just as man and woman shared governance in Eden. Correcting sexist caricatures through accurate Bible translations was for Bushnell crucial in upending women’s exploitation. For “nothing is of more importance to the Christian woman today than to understand that God did not Himself subordinate woman to man.”⁶ Women’s strength of character, glowing on the pages of Scripture, was needed to give the gospel power to dismantle male dominance and abuse. What began for Bushnell as solidarity with women enslaved in the global sex trade ended with exposing flawed Bible translations.\nWe stand united in Christ to proclaim women’s dignity and purpose through accurate Bible translations, remembering that dehumanizing ideas about people lead to dehumanizing actions. Correcting sexist translations and interpretations will have a redemptive impact on the global exploitation of women, as Bushnell’s life and research make clear.\nThis article appears in “Gendered Language and the Church,” the Autumn 2021 issue of Mutuality magazine. Read the full issue here.\nNotes\n\nKatharine Bushnell, God’s Word to Women, (Minneapolis, Minn.: Christians for Biblical Equality, 2003), 169.\nBushnell, God’s Word to Women, 633.\nBushnell, God’s Word to Women, 644.\nCyprian as quoted in Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum, Academia Litterarum Vindobonensis, vol. iii, p. 638.\nBushnell, God’s Word to Women, 644.\nBushnell, God’s Word to Women,  450.\n\nTo learn more about CBE’s Bible translation project, click here.\nhttps://www.cbeinternational.org/resource/correcting-caricatures-women-and-bible-translation/",

The key issue facing the Court was whether consent was a valid defence to assault in these circumstances. The Court answered in the negative. Within the judgement Lord Templeman stated this question can only be answered through consideration of policy and public interest”.3 The aforementioned judgement has been called “autonomy-constricting moralism”4 while justified as an act to protect society by criminal sanctions against a cult of violence which potentially fostered proselytisation of young men”.5 This critique will focus on key aspects of; the potential miscategorisation of the sadomasochistic acts therein as ‘violent’ as opposed to ‘sexual’, the consensual element at play, the dissenting judgements’ arguments on the acts’ illegality under existing laws on violence, and the level of harm issue in the ratio decedendi. With those in mind this critique will aim to highlight the potential legal weaknesses of this House of Lords decision.\nThe Facts, Judgement, and Ratio Decedendi of R v Brown [1993] UKHL 19\nIn this case, a group of men (appellants) willingly participated in the commission of sadomasochism against each other, including genital torture, for the sexual pleasure it evoked.6 Passive partners consented to the acts committed and suffered no permanent injury.7 The activities occured in private; albeit recorded solely for the delectation of the group.8 The appellants were tried on charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to s 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, and unlawful wounding, contrary to s 20 of that Act. The initial trial judge held that the consent of the victim afforded no defence to the charges, the appellants then pleaded guilty and were sentenced to terms of imprisonment.9 The appellants appealed against their convictions, contending that a person could not be guilty of assault of that nature in respect of consensual acts conducted in private. The Court of Appeal dismissed their appeals.10 The appellants appealed to the House of Lords who held, with Lord Mustill and Slynn dissenting, that consensual sadomasochistic encounters which occasion actual bodily harm to a victim is an assault. They held this in the interests of public policy. It thus followed that the appeals would be dismissed.11 The law following Brown seems to be that consensual assault causing ‘harm’ above the level of assault (such as in sadomasochism) is prima facie unlawful unless such behaviour falls within one of the exceptional categories grafted by the common law, which would subsequently legalise the conduct in question.12\nSadomasochism: Sex or violence?\nIn Brown the sadomasochistic acts were misguidedly characterised as ‘seriously violent’ and not ‘sexual’ thereby making them incapable of being ‘ratified’ by the concept of consent.13 Hence the judgement assumed: ‘that sex and violence are distinct and easily separable’ and that ‘consent to one is not necessarily consent to the other’.14 So, if the law insists upon mutual exclusivity, ‘is Brown about sexual practices between consenting adults in private, or is it about deviant, legally unprotected ‘violent’ sexual practices’?15 To support the former statement, it must be established that SM is legitimate sexual expression albeit involving violence, if so, then consent should and does play a role determining the criminalisation of any resulting harm. In Brown the ‘violent’ categorisation was founded on the infliction of pain within the acts. Yet what if pain is a subjective experience intrinsically linked with pleasure within the human nervous system? Hence, pain in a sadomasochistic context may not constitute ‘pain’ but sexual pleasure. Recent studies shed light on this phenomenon.  In one study, researchers used fMRI to visualise the brains of women as they stimulated themselves to climax, found that more than 30 areas of the brain were active, including those involved in pain.16 Another found cancer survivors, who had spinal nerves severed to relieve chronic pain, lost the ability to have orgasms.17 If their pain returned, so did the orgasms. Then a study into paracetamol affecting emotions18 found the painkilling drug relieved emotional pain, but blunted feelings of pleasure. The drug levelled-off highs as well as lows – an indicator that pain and sexual pleasure operate on shared biological pathways. For human beings, then, it appears that pain and pleasure are intertwined.19 Nafsika Athanassoulis communicated how this relates to Brown quite eloquently with the words “sadomasochism is sex expressed through violence”.20 Hence the characterisation of Brown as ‘violent’ is debunked and it is now asserted that sadomasochism is better characterised as ‘sexual’.\nConsent in Brown\nIf accepted that Brown sadomasochism is sexual then it is subject to the general rules of sexual consent and examined alongside the exceptional category of HIV transmission. If consent means ‘factual expressive consent’ 21, this was achieved in Brown. The conditions of freedom, knowledge, capacity, and motivation that are deemed necessary to ‘transmute X’s factual (expressive) consent into legal consent’,22 were fulfilled so the participant’s consent was not ‘legally defective’ due to coercion, deception or incompetence.23 Hence in Brown sadomasochism was sexually consensual. Robin Mackenzie criticised that only isolated acts of apparently sudden violence were exhibited on video to the judges, because ‘were the actions placed in the context of on-going negotiations and gradually increased stimulation (as seen in other parts of the video), a more empathetic understanding of such practices as [sexually consensual] might be, and indeed should be fostered’.24 However there is the element of harm occurring within Brown but a common law exceptional category exists which allows for informed consent to the risk of serious harm for sexual ends.\nThis is R v Dica.25 Dica concerned the transmission of HIV, which the law defines as grievous bodily harm (GBH) - a significantly more serious level of consensual harm than Brown allows for. Dica stated that parties can consent to the risk of transmission, which can be construed to mean that one can consent to the risk of serious harm for the sake of sexual gratification. Brown, by contrast, states that parties cannot consent to the risk of actual bodily harm (ABH) and ‘wounding’ for the sake of sexual gratification.26 Cowan observes that Dica allows for consensual harm within a sexual context, which justifies its derogation from Brown on the assumption the acts therein were ‘violent’. However this distinction from Brown is highly questionable if it is ‘sexual’ as our previous critique asserted. Furthermore the ‘harm’ in Brown came nowhere near the level of harm which was permissible in Dica, as HIV infection is an enduring life-long condition to manage27 whereas in Brown there was no lasting injury. The Dica ratio itself states there is a realm of private sexual relations in which the criminal law should not interfere,28 such logic which is clearly applicable to Brown. Therefore there is little evidence to justify this exclusion of Brown from the Dica exception. If sadomasochism, in the absence of permanent injury, constitutes the infliction of violence, it is illogical that HIV infection resulting from consensual risk-taking does not.29\nDica emphasises the severity of HIV infection to distinguish it from the ‘ordinary’ risks of unprotected sexual intercourse, such as unwanted pregnancy or common STIs. One can implicitly consent to these ‘lesser’ risks without an exceptional category. It is asserted that while Dica is right to distinguish HIV from the relative less considerable ‘ordinary’ sexual risks, it is misguided in its attempts to contrast SM with the ‘ordinary risks’, by equating it with HIV infection.30 This is questionable as Dica can seem to implicitly propose that one, if fully informed, ‘can expressly consent to the risk of HIV infection but not SM, because the risk of HIV is still one of those risks that (‘ordinary’) heterosexual intercourse incurs’31 which can be construed to evidence the court’s normative approach to sexually deviant homosexual practices. It is problematic if the law perceives the heterosexual transmission of a fatal disease more positively than impermanent/superficial injury caused by homosexual sadomasochism.\nInclusion of sadomasochistic behaviour as an offence under assault\nHenceforth this critique shall proceed assuming that the courts are not in a position to accept sadomasochism as a legitimate means of sexual expression. It will focus on the legal content of the judgements in R v Brown, with an emphasis on the rationale of those dissenting. As previously outlined, the decision in Brown was made with public policy at its core, to protect society through criminal sanctions from a ‘cult of violence’ which could convert young men to it.32 Yet, Lord Mustill outlines in his dissenting judgement, ‘corruption of youth is already catered for by the existing legislation’ ‘if there is a gap in it which needs to be filled the remedy surely lies in the hands of Parliament, not in the application of a statute which is aimed at other forms of wrong-doing’.33 Therein lies two important statements that reference other aspects of this judgement. That the public policy concern was addressed within pre-existing legislation, hence the Brown ratio is undermined and that there was not sufficient ground for declaring the Brown activities to be criminal under the Offences against the Person Act 1861.34 The later matter is debatable with contentions that the majority focused on the wrong legal idea,35 they fixated on establishing the sadomasochistic acts were criminal and did not adequately consider ‘Were they criminal under the Act of 1861?’. Lord Mustill stated the statute was “intended to penalise conduct of quite a different nature” and ponders “should in this new situation be interpreted so as to make it criminal”.36 Furthermore, Lord Slynn in his dissenting judgement in response to the DPP’s submission that it was a matter of policy; should the courts “adopt a paternalistic attitude as to what is bad or good for subjects, in particular as to deliberate injury”? He established it was an area of policy where social and moral factors were extremely important and changeable, hence “it [was] a matter of policy for the legislature to decide.”37 He further asserted it was not for the courts “to introduce into existing statutory crimes, concepts which did not properly fit there”. In his eyes it was the duty of Parliament to amend the Act of 1861 or the Sexual Offences Act 1967 for the Brown activities to be criminal under them.38 Hence it becomes apparent that the House of Lords, in their revulsion and eagerness to sanction the behaviour in Brown, may have extended the Offences Against the Persons Act 1861 to cover actions distinctly outside of its legal remit.\nLevel of harm\nAside from its inclusion under assault, there is another legal issue in Brown: the level of harm. In Brown the Lords heard from Mr. Purnell Q.C. that the appellants were liable under general law because the harm was to a degree where it went from non-criminal consensual violence to criminal.39 Hence the court sought to establish a border between the two, thus the level of harm appears in Brown’s ratio.40 Lord Slynn raised his concerns on this matter stating if a line is drawn “to be workable, it cannot be allowed to fluctuate within particular charges”.41 This has been evoked in recent works which ask ‘are the courts to start evaluating the validity of consent on the basis of some undeclared judicial barometer of the severity of harm?’42 Perhaps the qualifying level of harm is arguably determined by judicial creativity on a case by case basis?43 If we look to preexisting examples of applying the level of harm principle the negative answer becomes arguably more concrete. The Brown practices have been equated with those in R v Emmett,44 where a man tied a plastic bag over the head of his partner and on another occasion poured lighter fluid over her and set it alight in the pursuit of sexual gratification, and was therefore deemed to cause harm of too high a level to be legal. But this is debatably wrong, because the risks posed and harm caused in the latter were arguably much higher than those in Brown, including loss of consciousness and serious burns.45 The European Court of Human Rights subsequently distinguished R v Wilson,46 which concerned the branding of a woman by her husband for sexual gratification but was deemed legally exempt under assault due to the exceptional category of body modification (specifically tattooing), because the injuries in that case were considered ‘not at all comparable in seriousness’47 with those in Brown or Emmett. Yet in Wilson the injuries themselves amounted to ABH namely the level of harm incurred in Brown. Hence if we are to look at how the precedent of Brown has been interpreted it solidifies the argument that Brown is an inherently poor judgement with respect to the factors considered in its determination.\nConclusion\nR v Brown and the subsequent criminalisation of the sadomasochistic behaviour therein under the Offences against the Person Act 1861 coupled with the legal precedents it created are inherently flawed. As established within this critique the Court’s characterisation of Brown as ‘violent’ is questionable given the compelling evidence and arguments that is is better understood in a ‘sexual’ context. Had it been viewed within this context the consensual nature of the sadomasochistic behaviour could have absolved the appellants of criminal culpability. Furthermore, if accepted as ‘sexual’, then Brown’s potential inclusion under Dica becomes notably less objectionable and thus the question of allowing one to consent to GBH but not ABH sheds light on the Court’s normative approach to Brown. Additionally, the dissenting judgements in Brown present insight into the Court’s potential manipulation or misconstruing of the Act of 1861 in their efforts to criminalise the aforementioned actions and express a notable concern over the usage of a ‘level of harm’ principle in a legal setting.

		"content": "Link to the article\nWhen I was eight years old, one of my teachers was named Mrs. Moorehouse. After school one day, I was talking to my mum and accidentally referred to her as Mrs. “Hoorehouse.” While I was merely surprised at the slip, my mum was shocked. But then, she thought I’d said “whorehouse.”\nGrowing up with gospel stories read from the 1984 NIV English translation, it’s possible that I had a growing awareness of the word “prostitute.” But the word “whore” was, evidently, unknown to me. Neither it nor any of its derivatives are used once in the NIV. They are, however, used ninety-one times in the ESV.\nI discovered this as I was studying Ezekiel 16.\nEzekiel 16: A Difficult Passage to Say the Least\nLikely written around the time of the southern kingdom’s exile to Babylon, the chapter describes the history of the people of Judah’s relationship with God using an extended metaphor. Judah, or more specifically Jerusalem, is depicted as a foundling who grows up to become a sexually unfaithful wife to God. The whole story is saturated with graphic descriptions of nakedness, sex, and violence.\nVery broadly, responses to the text lie somewhere between two extremes. A full embrace of this passage sees God acting in unmerited compassion and generosity, only to be grossly betrayed; he responds to Jerusalem’s unfaithfulness in righteous anger and just punishment, culminating in a merciful promise of restoration.1 On the other hand, full resistance to the text frames God as an absentee benefactor who abandons Jerusalem until she’s old enough for him to make her his arm candy. When she acts out, this view would say God behaves like a textbook abuser,2 giving Jerusalem no voice whatsoever, at any time.3\nClearly, there are serious questions about the purpose of Ezekiel’s rhetoric and how much this passage is intended to reveal the character of God. It is also no small task to consider how the text should be presented and discussed within the church, bearing in mind that many readers will be women and/or survivors of domestic and sexual abuse.\nWhat I want to explore is how this conversation is likely to be influenced by translation choices, particularly in the case of the ESV and its use of the word “whore.”\n“Whore” in the ESV\nThe Cambridge Dictionary offers two definitions for whore. One is archaic and refers to a female prostitute. The other more modern usage is offensive and refers to “a woman whose behaviour in her sexual relationships is considered immoral.”4\nAt a glance, the ESV seems to use “whore” mainly in its archaic sense. Phrases like “you lavished your whorings” from Ezekiel 16:15 certainly look old-fashioned (and show up in a spell check). But there’s more going on here.\nOfficially, the use of “whore” reflects reliance on the KJV tradition.5 But if the translators thought “whore” was still preferable over a modern term, then why just this term? For example, in 1 Samuel 25:22, David swears that he won’t leave a single male person alive from Naboth’s household. The ESV uses the word “male” even though the KJV says “any that pisseth against a wall.” Why use “whore” but not “piss”? Given that both are now offensive terms, I can’t help but think this is an example of translation bias.\nMeanwhile, whether intended or not, it’s hard for a modern reader to read “whore” without its negative connotations. And in the context of Ezekiel 16, that matters. We’re led to believe that either:\n\npejorative use is justifiable and righteous, or\npejorative use is not justifiable and the text is deliberately (and provocatively) depicting God as unrighteous.\n\nGiven the troubling narrative as a whole, we shouldn’t immediately rule out the second option. However, it’s very unlikely the ESV translators believed the text was presenting an unreliable portrait of God. Even if they did, that doesn’t explain all the uses of “whore” in the ESV outside of the book of Ezekiel.\nIt seems more likely that the translators were willing to ignore, or even embrace, the misogynistic overtones the word “whore” now has.\nBut there’s more.\nMetaphor Upon Metaphor\nModern readers might not realize it, but there are two levels of metaphor at work in this chapter. The more obvious one is the wider depiction of the spiritual unfaithfulness of the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the image of the woman’s sexual immorality.\nBut metaphor also operates within individual phrases that use the Hebrew root znh. In Old Testament culture, married and betrothed women were expected to have sex with one man only, for as long as he was alive. If this norm was violated, a married woman might be described as “prostituting” herself, but the intended meaning was not that she worked as a prostitute. It was that she was being sexually immoral.6\nIn other words, most of the phrases in Ezekiel 16 about the woman’s “prostitution” are metaphorical. We misread the text if we think the author is telling us this woman’s behaviour is that of a sex worker; the narrative even labors how the woman was unlike a prostitute (verses 31 and 34).\nOnce we realize this, we can see that translators have a choice about what they do with each individual phrase. They can preserve the original image used in the Hebrew or state the intended underlying meaning without using a metaphor.7\nThe ESV and NIV tend to take the first option, but the CEB, an ecumenical translation that aims to be comfortably readable for most English readers, takes varied approaches depending on context.\nFor example, if we look at the Hebrew root znh (meaning to act as a prostitute), it occurs eighteen times in verses 15–34, fifteen of which are metaphorical.8 The ESV translates it with derivatives of “whore” all fifteen times. The NIV recognizes when the Hebrew is using particular turns of phrase, so it uses “prostitute” eight times, “promiscuity” three times, “favors” three times, and leaves it untranslated once. Meanwhile, the CEB uses “prostitute” only five times, leaves it untranslated once, and uses other phrases including “traded,” “seduce,” “promiscuity,” and “favors.”\nWe can see this trend in the rest of the Old Testament too.\nTo be clear, directly translating the original Hebrew metaphor is a valid translation choice. But metaphors carry different overtones and emotive effects depending on the reader’s context. If a translation chooses to preserve a particular image, we need to ask whether that’s down to a more literal translation style or actually reflects a convenience for the translator’s ideology.\nPut another way, when metaphorical use of the root znh is translated into English terms associated with prostitution, does that reflect a willingness on the part of the translator to stigmatise sex workers and/or women who exercise sexual agency?\nIf so, we have a problem.\nWhy All of This Matters for Readers\nMy point here is not to put forward a defence of sex work. However, given the many complex reasons why women (and men) can take up prostitution, it’s important to resist using this Hebrew metaphor without appropriate justification. And we definitely shouldn’t be adding to it in a chapter as rhetorically loaded as Ezekiel 16.\nThis is where the ESV translation choices become even more strange. As I mentioned, the ESV preserves the metaphorical use of the root znh all fifteen times in verses 15–34; this is consistent with the ESV’s more literal translation style. However, in the three times the Hebrew refers to a sex worker (verses 30, 31, and 33), the ESV uses “prostitute,” not “whore.” In other words, “whore” isn’t just being used because it’s archaic.\nThe effect of this shouldn’t be underappreciated in such a highly complex and emotive passage. The strange mix of the archaic and modern puts a veneer of authority and respectability over the pejorative intent behind “whore.” It discourages modern readers from resisting the text and collapses the complexities of Ezekiel’s rhetoric and prophetic purpose. It encourages us to believe, as feminist scholar Peggy Day so bluntly puts it, “the bitch had it coming to her.”\nLeaving aside how this dangerously steers toward victim blaming, such an interpretation is also deeply flawed. As Day argues, the text is not about sex, but apostasy, about abandoning God. If we read it as about sex and marital relationships, then it doesn’t portray a measured judicial process for infidelity, but a vicious and absurd sexual revenge fantasy; after all, the male adulterous lovers do not share the woman’s punishment but participate in inflicting it.9\nIn contrast, if we read the chapter as inescapably about apostasy, then the text becomes a deliberately distressing description of the foreign conquests of Jerusalem. It may even be inviting us to identify with Jerusalem.10\nConcluding Thoughts\nThere is much, much more that could be explored on this topic, particularly in the books of Hosea, Nahum, and Proverbs. And there are definitely questions to be asked of other translations, including the NIV and CEB—the latter uses “whore” four times in the Old Testament, three of which are in a single verse (Nahum 3:4).\nBut we should question what purpose is served by the sheer volume of times “whore” is used in the ESV, not just in Ezekiel 16 but throughout the Old Testament. Because this didn’t happen by accident. It reflects deliberate translation choices—firstly, to preserve the metaphorical use of the root word znh (both in its own right and within turns of phrase), and secondly, to use an English word which, when we hear it today, almost always carries derogatory intent.\nAs for Ezekiel 16, we need to remember that it’s not about sex, but apostasy. It stacks up as a description of Jerusalem’s failed alliances with foreign nations, but it breaks down if read as a picture of marital relations.\nUltimately, we will each have to decide for ourselves how much we resist or embrace the rhetoric force of this highly complex passage of Scripture. I first read it when I was eighteen, as I was working my way through the book of Ezekiel. I won’t lie, even with the graphic content of this chapter (and chapter 23), the book enlivened my faith in a way that surprised and inspired me, and I’m never going to forget that. However, I was thirty-seven before I heard anyone in my church community acknowledge the violence of this particular passage. If I’m honest, that left me angry.\nIt is my hope that if we can talk about Ezekiel 16 better, then we will, in time, translate it better too. That won’t stop readers from being unsettled by it, but it will give them more space to ask critical questions of the text and wrestle to find their own answers.\nThis article appears in “Gendered Language and the Church,” the Autumn 2021 issue of Mutuality magazine. Read the full issue here.\nNotes\n\nPeggy Day gives a review of scholars who explicitly or implicitly interpret the chapter this way. See Peggy L. Day, “The Bitch Had It Coming to Her: Rhetoric and Interpretation in Ezekiel 16,” Biblical Interpretation 8, no. 3 (2000): 231–54.\nThe passage follows the “three-stage cycle of abuse”: tension-building, acute violence, followed by kindness and contrite behaviour. Linda Day, “Rhetoric and Domestic Violence in Ezekiel 16,” Biblical Interpretation 8 (2000): 205–30, quoted in Bryan D. Bibb, “There’s No Sex in Your Violence: Patriarchal Translation in Ezekiel 16 and 23,” Review &amp; Expositor 111, no. 4 (December 2014): 339.\nSee in particular Carol J. Dempsey, “The ‘Whore’ of Ezekiel 16: The Impact and Ramifications of Gender-Specific Metaphors in Light of Biblical Law and Divine Judgment,” in Gender and Law in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East, edited by Victor H. Matthews et al. (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic, 1998), 57–78; and Aaron Koller “Pornography or Theology?: The Legal Background, Psychological Realism, and Theological Import of Ezekiel 16,” The Catholic Biblical Quarterly 79, no. 3 (July 2017): 402–21.\nCambridge Dictionary.\nBibb, “There’s No Sex in Your Violence,” 342.\nSee Day, “The Bitch Had It Coming To Her,” 236. In Peggy Day’s discussions about the structure and impact of metaphors, she cites Julie Galambush’s argument around the metaphorical use of znh. Julie Galambush, “Jerusalem in the Book of Ezekiel: The City as Yahweh’s Wife,” SBLDS, 130 (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1992), 25–88.\nA third translation choice would be to use a different image to convey a similar emotive effect to today’s readers. For example, the US phrase “kick the can down the road” could be translated in the UK as “kick the ball into the long grass.” However, this kind of translation would be difficult to achieve in a complex and layered passage like Ezekiel 16, and I don’t know of an English translation that attempts to do so with this passage.\nAs Carol Dempsey observes, the root znh occurs in verse 15 (twice), 16, 17, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31, 33 (twice), and 34 (twice). See Dempsey, “The ‘Whore’ of Ezekiel 16,” 68.\nSee Day, “The Bitch Had It Coming To Her,” 231–54.\nSee Koller, “Pornography or Theology?” 412–414.",

He believes that the body and soul are separate, and that the soul lives on after the death of the body.\nPlato's principles on body and soul\n\nbody and soul are opposites — material and imperfect versus spiritual and perfect. They are two separate substances that interact.\nChanging — the body is constantly changing so cannot be a source of truth. The soul is immortal, in the world of forms, unchanging, and a source of truth\nThe soul is the real identity of a person — we have a body, but we aren't a body: our inner mental life is the most important part of ourselves.\nIn conflict — soul seeks intellectual pleasure. Monkey brain want physical pleasure. Conflict.\nCharioteer — reason is the highest thing and allows us to know the world of forms, emotion inspires us but can make us reckless, appetites ensure we look after our bodies but can lead us into hedonism. A good person is one with reason in charge.\nForms — soul is in a higher reality and wants to return to the world of forms. We have knowledge because our soul has experienced it in the world of forms.\nMortality — anything material cannot be everlasting, permanence is part of the 'true essence' and the soul is immortal, so it's purer, cannot be broken down, and must carry on living.\n\nPlato's actual arguments\nThe cyclical argument — if birth leads to death, then death must lead to birth.\n\nThis is 'begging the question' (fallacy)\nAlso, this is cum hoc ergo propter hoc: correlation does not equal causation. Just because life is linked to death, does not mean death is linked to life.\n\nThe recollection argument — all knowledge is just stuff you remember.\n\nHow can a child learn so quickly? They must know it from a previous life.\n\nThis is a non sequitur fallacy, or a faulty generalisation fallacy: the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premises/ the conclusion is based on weak premises.\n\nThe affinity argument — The soul survives death. Since the body is mortal and composed of many parts, the soul — which is not composed of many parts — must be immortal.\n\nThis is a false dilemma, (the soul and body are opposites) into affirming the consequent (if A then B; B, therefore A — if death (A) follows from life (B), then life must follow from death)\n\nThe argument from opposites — since death is the opposite of life, and opposites are mutually exclusive, when the body dies life must go on. This is just the cyclical argument part 2.\n\nagain, begging the question\n\nDescartes\nDescartes believes that the mind is interdependent, the mind and soul (which he does not make distinction between) are where all thoughts/sensations/ideas occur.\n\n[!QUOTE]\nThe soul has &quot;thought but not extension&quot; and the body has &quot;extension but not thought.&quot;\n\nHe believes that the mind/soul interact with the body through the 'pineal gland' in the brain. This is, of course, complete crap. He called this complete crap Cartesian Dualism.\n\nFor more info, read this article, it goes more into depth on his position. It's quite short and a good read.\n\nProperty dualism\n\n[!SUMMARY]\nThe body and soul are different but interact as part of the same substance — i.e. when the body dies, the soul dies.\n\nAristotle\n\nthe body is matter and the soul is the form\n\nthe soul shapes the body, gives it it's qualities/purpose; the soul is the Formal, Efficient, and Final cause.\n\nThe soul cannot act without a body, and a body cannot act without a soul.\n\nthe soul and body are inseparable because they interact so closely.\n\nThe eye and axe analogies\n\nThe eye is simply an object. It's Formal cause is 'sight.' There is no 'eye' without the action of sight\n\nWhat makes up an axe is not only it's materials, but it's 'capacity to chop.' This is it's Formal cause\n\nThe soul is the Formal cause of the body\n\nAquinas\n\nbro just agrees with Aristotle but adds Christianity onto it.\n- He uses Aristotle's arguments for the existence of a soul but then completely ignores the ones which indicate that the soul does not survive death.\n\nthe soul is united with it's resurrection body to enjoy heaven/the kingdom of God after death.\n\nAlthough he adds that the soul operates independently, and so can survive death.\n\nThe 'G' in Gilbert Ryle stands for 'Goat'\nRyle criticises Descartes' substance dualism using the analogy of &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;\n\ni.e. they can't be separate if they interact.\n\nIf you read the article on Descartes above, it provides a lot more depth to these arguments.\n\nHe also uses the idea of a 'category error'\n\nA category error is like when - after being shown around one building in a university, you say 'can I see the university now?'\nactions have to be of both the body and mental state — they cannot be separated and categorised into different things because they are sub-elements of the same thing\n\nthis links back to Aristotle's ideas\n\nFinally, he uses the Holistic argument: i.e. looking at a person as a whole; he thinks that the body and soul are one thing.\n\nThis is the weakest argument. Don't use it unless you agree with dualism and want a bad argument on the opposite side to counter.\n\nVarious other philosophers on mind-body-soul\nJohn Hick\n\nthe soul is a gift from God (Aquinas)\n&quot;my soul is not me&quot; — without the physical body, you wouldn't be identifiable, you need both parts (Aristotle)\nthe body has a spiritual dimension: the soul (???)\n\nElizabeth Anscombe\n\npurpose influence — we have reasons behind our actions, reasons behind our thought processes.\n\n&quot;bodily is an act of man qua spirit.&quot;\n\nThe body and soul relate to each other in order to make a human being\n\nSkinner and Behaviourism\nBehaviourism is a type of materialism.\n\nit posits that thoughts are just learned behaviours: mental acts are explainable at a physical level which would direct to not believing in a soul that directs us.\n\nsee the Pavlov's dogs experiments for examples of learned mental behaviours\nalso see that our brain takes a lot of shortcuts to function. It is a tad crazy how much we work on assumptions.\n\nWhy do we need to have a soul?\nHard problem of conciousness\nThis was created by David Chalmers. He argues that bodily function alone cannot explain the depth of human conciousness — so therefore there must be a soul/ some separate substance.\n\nYou could, if you wanted to, counter this with the argument from ignorance fallacy: just because you can't prove it, doesn't mean it isn't true.\n\nOther philosphers\nDaniel C. Dennett\n\nhumans can't be reduced to learned behaviours, Skinner's reasons would only be correct if Dennett's explanation of something stopped at having a desire — but our thinking goes much further.\n\nSkinner oversimplifies human conciousness — to him there is no difference between human or pigeon\n\nJohn Cottingham\n\nIf we are just mind and body, no soul — it doesn't make sense: the human experiences of passion, emotions, and sensations cannot be reduced to either category.\n\nSummary of strengths and weaknesses\nPlato's substance dualism\n\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\n\nmental and physical are very different realms — certain mental things cannot be reduced to something physical, like emotions\nWhy not? Physical things often cause mental things.\n\ngives hope and purpose for another life\nappeal to emotion\n\nCould solve the problem of evil — i.e. Buddhist idea of karma, (you are suffering now because you were evil in a past life)\nThis is reliant on the world of forms.\n\nexplains deja vu and other strange human experiences — like intuition\nargument from ignorance\n\nIt's obvious that there is no physical evidence for a soul — the idea of physical evidence for something immaterial is nonsensical.\nThere is no physical evidence for a soul (Dawkins)\n\nwe have different physical perceptions — if we all experienced the world of forms then surely that... wouldn't be the case?\n\nWhy do things have to have opposites? Why does death have to lead to life? Hunger doesn't bring about fullness, etc\n\nwe see ourselves as unified — not a separate soul operating a machine. Our bodies are often core parts of our identities.\n\nit makes the physical world seem pointless. Why not just kill ourselves to get to the world of forms?\n\nthere is absolutely no evidence for the multiple assumptions Plato uses to argue for dualism (world of forms, argument from opposites, etc)\n\nhow does a spirit interact with a body? They are two different substances.\n\nif all souls came from the world of forms, wouldn't everyone be as clever as each other/ have access to the same intuition/knowledge?\n\nAristotle's property dualism strengths and weaknesses\n\nStrengths\nweaknesses\n\nwe are a unified whole\nstill the same case of how can a spiritual thing and material thing interact\n\nno empirical evidence for an afterlife -&gt; so there isn't one!\nwhy, since spirit and body are opposites, is it not the case that the soul lives on?",

We have a different view of if something is near or far depending on where we are.\n\nITS THE FUCKING EPISTEMIC GAP YOU MOTHERFUCKER\nGod is unlimited by space and time- he is limitless\n\ndo other work here babes\nKatherine Rogers\n-&gt; Although the points of a circle's circumference are all in different places relative to one another, they all share the same relationship with the centre of the circle; likewise, God shares the same relationship with each and every point in time\nSecond analogy\n\nis between a mountain climber surveying a landscape and God surveying time: just as a mountain climber can see the entire landscape from the summit of the mountain, so can God see each and every moment in time stretched out before him from his vantage point.\n\nFree will?\n\ndoes God's foreknowledge of our actions allow free will?\n\nGod's eternity is the 4th dimension: he knows our future as unchanged whereas we inside time see the future changing because of our choice\nthis means Anselm does not deny the reality of our temporal world but God is in a non-temporal world\n\nGod can justifiably judge us because we are morally responsible\n\nwe have chosen freely and God can see at all times. This is all happening, &quot;at the same time, it exists simultaneously in an eternal presence&quot;\n\nWatch your language!\n\nsince we have no other vocabulary, it means we find it difficult to grasp God's knowledge and action so it is difficult for us to talk about the fourth dimension\nOne question might be- how can God be part of our world if the eternity of God is in another dimension?\n\nconsider:\n\nthe significance of Jesus\nwhat happens when we pray\nis God a personal God if he is in another dimension?\n\nSwinburne's criticisms\n&quot;the worst person you know just made a great point.&quot; :(\nSummary of key points\n\nit's unbiblical\nlogically incoherent\nmakes no sense in light of worship and prayer\n\nHezekiah (Bible story)\nIn those days, Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amos went to him and said, &quot;This is what the Lord says; put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover.&quot;\nHezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord &quot;remember Lord, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.&quot; And Hezekiah wept bitterly.\nThen the word of the Lord came to Isaiah. &quot;Go and tell Hezekiah, 'this is what the Lord, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add 15 years to your life.&quot;\n\nOften in the Old testament, God pronounces judgement and then forgives people and allows them a fresh start. This judgement culminates in Jesus' death and resurrection.\n\nSwinburne points out that when Christians worship and pray they are interacting with God and speak of a personal relationship\n\n&quot;A totally immutable God is a lifeless God.&quot;\nHowever, in this verse, God has perfect knowledge of what he will do and his intentions are fixed or his views are fixed.\n'Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?'\nThis verse suggests divine timelessness:\n\n'&quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega,&quot; says the Lord God, &quot;who is, and who was, and who is to come, the almighty.&quot;'\n\nA loving God cannot be immutable (even is he loves unconditionally.)

If he does, then it suggests that the future is fixed and we have no free will.\n\n==If we have free will, then we cannot be blamed or praised for our actions\n==Religion teaches that God gave us free will, so that we may make our own decisions, decide our own futures, with no coercion from God\n\nIf God knows all things throughout time (as he must if he is omniscient) then he knows every action I perform, every decision I make throughout my life, before I have done them.\n\nIf God knows everything, then he must know what I am going to do before I do it.\nFor example, that I am going to drink this glass of water. If God knows it, then it must be true that I drink the water. If it's true that I drink the water, then it can't be false that I drink the water. That means |I have no choice, I will drink the water. This means either God is omniscient but we lack free will or we have free will but God is not omniscient (and therefore not God)\none response to this is to argue that God's omniscience extends to all things that are possible to know, but free will makes it impossible to know the future\nAlso- a God that makes a soul that is guaranteed to go to hell and suffer for eternity is evil.\nIf God knows everything, how do we know he hasn't also predetermined those things?\n\nProblem of evil yippee\n\nif god is 'eternal' and our behavior is predetermined or foreseen, then is God partly responsible for evil actions brought about by our free choices?\nCan he be omni-benevolent? If he can foresee evil then why does he not prevent it?\n\nBoethius (the bitch)\nIn his book 'The Consolation of Philosophy'- Lady Philosophy states God's foreknowledge isn't the cause of future events happening\n\nGod is eternal but we still have freedom- he says that God's knowledge is causal- he sees the future but in doing so is simply foreseeing the actions that humans choose out of free will\n\nAugustine\n\nif you have a friend that you know very well, you may know that he is about to sin. But your knowledge does not cause him to sin. Similarly God doesn't cause someone to sin but sees beforehand those who are going to sin by their own will.\nBUT\nthis analogy is unfair; the foreknowledge of the friend and of God are different. The former cannot be wrong, whereas human foreknowledge can\n\nAquinas\n\nbuilt upon Boethius- God takes in all history as a whole, he has a 'birds-eye' perspective. God looks down from above at what choices will be made but this knowledge of the choices that will be made isn't casual- free choices can still be made\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/philosophy/01-philosophy/nature-and-attributes-of-god/anselm-s-theories/\">Anselm's theories</a>\n#lessonmajor",

(e.g. The cat is asleep on the chair.)\nNon-cognitive language: language that cannot be proven to be true or false through knowledge (emotive, moral, and ethical language. Like saying &quot;yippee!&quot;)\nWhat do we mean by religious language?\n\nSpecialist terms- life 'Eucharist, 'messiah', etc.\nOld fashioned words from acts of worship: 'thou art', and 'blessed be he'\nTruth-claims- i.e. statements about what is or is not the case ('Jesus is alive today)\nExpressing feelings/emotions: 'we are truly sorry and repent for all our sins'\nused to announce something has happened or is about to happen: &quot;I baptize you in the name of the Lord&quot; is using Religious language performatively\nPrescriptively: encouraging people not to act certain ways (&quot;Honour your father and mother... you shall not murder.&quot;)\n\nTerminology (again)\nA MYTH is a story that has deep explanatory or symbolic resonance for a culture and one that is believed to be true by those who tell it. The term is sometimes used pejoratively in reference to common beliefs of a culture or for the beliefs of a religion to imply that the story is both fanciful and fictional.\nA PARABLE is a story that is told to illustrate a religious, moral or philosophical idea. In rhetoric, a PARABLE ('comparison' or 'similitude') was originally the name given by Greek rhetoricians to any fictive illustration introduced in the form of a brief narrative.\nA SYMBOL is a representation of an idea, thing, concept, or quality.\nA word, for example, is a SYMBOL of language, which references its own definition. That is, it &quot;stands for&quot; some idea, thing, concept, or quality, as defined by its given language.\nA METAPHOR is a figure of speech that is used to paint one concept with the attributes normally associated with another.\nAn ANALOGY is a comparison between two things. ANALOGIES are often used to introduce new concepts, by comparing them to something familiar, or to support political and philosophical arguments.\nA PROPOSITION is what is asserted as the result of uttering a sentence. In other words, it is the meaning of the sentence, rather than the sentence itself. Different sentences can express the same PROPOSITION, if they have the same meaning.\nA SIMILIE is a figure of speech that expresses a resemblance between things of different kinds (usually formed with 'like' or 'as')\n\nVia affirmativia (the cataphatic way)\n\nin religious language it is assumed that God can be spoken of in the affirmative- that we can make positive claims about him. We do this by using positive qualities of human experience and applying them to God\nFor example, there is qualities such as 'goodness', 'truth' and 'love' which we understand in our own lives and experiences. These can also be applied to God- it makes sense to speak of God as 'good' or 'just' etc\nadherents include Aquinas, Augustine, and Anselm\n\nWeaknesses to this approach\n\n&quot;The first time when you seek God, you only find darkness: and as it were a cloud of unknowing... This darkness and this cloud is, whatever you do, between you and God, and... you may not see him clearly by the light of your understanding in your reason... for if ever you shall feel him or see him... it is right always to be in this cloud in this darkness.&quot;\n\nLiterally just the epistemic gap. I am fucking sick of this shite.\n\nGod is infinite and wholly immaterial and transcendent- so how can 'God talk' tell us real facts about God if he is not a being to which the human language of nouns, adjectives and verbs can apply?\n\nIT'S THE FUCKING EPISTEMIC GAP\n\nLanguage is subjective. People have different concepts of justice, love, kindness, etc\nIt's misleading- if we say God is a father or a shepherd, then many people may think that God has a body, or is male, or has faults. What about 'God is love' or 'God is good'?\n\nsome argue that it is better to accept the mysteries of God than try to pin God down using human/flawed concepts.\n\nVia negativa (the apophatic way)\n\nliterally means the 'negative way' because God can only be described in terms of what God is not.\n- apophatic comes from the Greek word 'apophasis'- which means 'negation.'\n\nIt argues that God is transcendent so you cannot say what God is.\n\nHowever you can clearly say what God is not;\n\nGod is not a human being because God is transcendent, so God cannot have a body.\n\nEqually, when Christians say God is good they may not know exactly what they mean, when they use the word 'good'\n\nbut they know for sure that God is not evil.\n\nArguably, speaking about God in negative terms avoids the problem of misrepresenting God.\nUltimately, language cannot describe God.\n\npeople who believe in the apophatic way are not saying that you cannot say things about God- such as 'God is /omniscient/omnibenevolent etc', but that this language does not actually tell us about God because our knowledge of goodness is that of a human being.\n\nOUR LANGUAGE IS CREATED BY US, AND SO IS FLAWED IN THE SAME WAYS THAT WE ARE\n\n==ITS THE FUCKING EPISTEMIC GAP!!\n\nIf we talk about God being all-knowing then we can debate what this means, but in the end we cannot know for certain what it is to be all knowing.\nMany religious people have maintained that philosophy and talk about God are misleading and that instead of bringing us closer to an understanding of God, language may have the opposite effect.\nThe way to know God is to remove language itself- since it places God in the limits of human language. Instead emphasis should be given to mysticism, spirituality &amp; prayer, as paths to a deeper understanding of God.\n\nSupporting scholars\nFake Dionysius\nThe apophatic way was developed by the early church writer Pseudo Dionysius, or Dionysius the Aeropagite.\n\nHis writings originated much later than the time of the apostles- because he is not the Dionysius of the Acts of the Apostles. This is why he is called 'pseudo'\n\nIf we say God is good then we have to say God is not good, because we do not really know what it means to say God is Good. In 'The mystical theology'- the fake god stated that God is 'beyond assertion' and 'beyond denial' - whatever you say about God ultimately does not tell us anything about God, and you cannot say absolutely what God is not.\nIn 'Divine names' and 'the mystical union'- he develops the view that through prayer an individual could be united with God through abandoning senses, images and language.\n\nInfluenced by Plato, he argued that the soul's search for God was held back by the demands of the body and the mind's desire for understanding.\n=&gt; stop trying to use logic and arguments! Allow God to speak in the stillness- accepting God will remain a mystery.\nMaimonides\nHe is a Jewish 12th century philosopher.\nHe argues that human beings can know that God exists but not anything about God, because God is not like human beings\n\nhe finds support in Jewish scriptures where God is described as being 'i am who i am'- literally called Yawhey (I am)- he is beyond any description.\nhe speaks about the dangers of anthropomorphising God\n\nallows man to compare himself to God based on characteristics\n\nsuch as with sex, race, etc\n\nThe hand and mouth of God\nRather we come nearer to knowledge of God through negative attributes, for example God is not limited, and so on.\n\nHe gives the example of a ship to illustrate what he meant.\nEssentially, you learn about something by describing what it is not. i.e. the process of elimination.\nTHIS IS THE ONENOTE FOR THIS LESSON IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT.\nhttps://whsat.sharepoint.com/sites/Section_WHS14021/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={36aa2c81-36fa-44cc-b896-64f426a01bf5}&amp;action=view&amp;wd=target(Leah Johnston%2FPaper 1.one|c6a694ad-780f-4fce-a139-4a1cdca2eca1%2FRel Lang via affirmativa\\%2Fnegativa|81e2f779-ea97-4544-9285-1ff6064f3234%2F)&amp;wdorigin=NavigationUrl\n\nSt. John of the Cross; a famous mystic\nGod is neither material, not the vital, nor the mental, nor the personal soul. He is nothing created. He is not within creation.\nBackground to the apophatic way\nIt came from the philosophy of Plotinus in the second century CE. Plotinus was at the centre of a movement that reviewed interest in the philosophy of Plato. He linked Plato's Form of the Good with God. Because of this link God is seen as completely separate and beyond this world, just as the Form of the Good is the highest Form and separate from the other forms.\nWeaknesses of the apophatic way\nAnthony Flew argues that if we say that God is invisible, soundless, incorporeal, and so on, there is little difference between our definition of God and our definition of nothingness.\n\nyou could say everything via negativa and it ends up being via positiva.\n\nit is a way of recognising that we have to go beyond our normal everyday experiences",

		"content": "<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Analogy</a>\nWorksheet questions\nAccording to Aquinas, we can say positive/affirmative things about god.\nUnder what condition?\nAquinas says that via positiva can be used when it is expressly analogy.\nAquinas was opposed to using univocal and equivocal language when talking about God\nWhy did he reject this?\nUnivocal language is too limiting of an infinite God, equivocal language does not allow us to gain knowledge of God through reason because of subjectivity.\nExample of equivocal language\nTable, punch, illness, etc\nThe same word when applied to God means something totally different when applied to human beings.\nWhy did Aquinas reject this?\nBecause it doesn't allow us to gain knowledge through reason\nInstead, Aquinas recommended analogical language.\nWhat assumption does Aquinas make?\nThat God can be understood/that human language can understand God\nAquinas distinguished between two types\n\nAnalogy of attribution - we ascribe a quality to one thing because it is caused by another.\nFor example, a skilled baker makes loaf of bread. We ascribe that the bread is good because the baker is skilled.\nWhat is Aquinas' Analogy of the Bull?\nIf the bulls urine is healthy then the bull is healthy, and if the bull is healthy then the urine must be healthy.\nSimilarly, God produces everything in the world.\nWhat do we mean when we say God is 'good, wise and loving.'\nGod is the source of 'good, wise and loving' — he is perfectly all of these things all of the time. This is basically Plato's idea of forms.\nALTHOUGH, just because he has those attributes, doesn't mean he is the source of those attributes\n\nAnalogy of proportion\nWe ascribe a quality to one thing because it points towards another thing which has that quality. The words that relate to objects are different in proportion.\nGive an example&gt;\nThe dog is clever, but only as clever as dogs go — and the scientist is clever (which is compared to other people.)\nHow can a mother's love for her daughter point to divine love?\nHuman love points to divine love, like how dog's cleverness points to human cleverness\nIs analogy a clear way of understanding God?\nA more modern version of the idea of speaking about God with analogy comes from Ian Ramsey. He tried to explain the way that religious language could usefully describe God, by using 'models and qualifiers.'\nA model assists us to understand the thing that it represents, it is an analogy to help us express something about God. 'God is good' contains the model 'good.' We understand the human concept of goodness, and we apply it as a model to understand the nature of God.\nWhy do we need to adapt the model?\nBecause God is infinite, and humans are finite\nWhat does the qualifier do?\nThe qualifier is how we adapt the model- to make it infinite.\n(model can also be caused 'ideal/idea')\n\nModel\nQualifier\n\nCause\nGod is uncaused, God is the causer ()\n\nWise\nOmniscience\n\nGood\nPerfect and unending — God is the source of goodness\n\nCreation\nCreated everything, including non-physical things\n\nThe model is our understanding of a word. It is like a toy plane to a toy man — the toy man can understand the concept of a plane, but cannot comprehend the scale of a real plane — the qualifier is what the toy man uses to explain that there is an uncomprehend-able difference in scale. We use qualifiers to apply our human concepts to God.\n\nwhat are the strengths of using analogy?\n\nAcknowledges the flawed and unnuanced nature of human language.\nAllows us to gain knowledge of God through reason, using language as the tool.\n\nWhat are the weaknesses of using analogy?\n\nIt's still using human language. It can explicitly never be a perfect description, and so can never be accurate.\nEpistemic gap\nStill using equivocal language\n\nTest of knowledge\n\nAquinas speaks of two Analogies, what are these? Attribution and proportion.\n\nExample for each analogy — analogy of the Bull for attribution, analogy of the dog for proportion.\n\nBrummer is critical of this was because he says we are not entitled to make claims about God.\nBarth is critical of analogy because it suggests we can't come to God through experience. What do we need? Revelation.\nPositive language can also be called cataphatic or via affirmativa\nNegative language can be called apophatic or via negativa\nName someone connected to the apophatic way. Maimonides or Pseudo Dionysus\nIf one realises the transcendence of God, one will realise the limitations of expressing anything about God, so one might liken this way to the via negativa.\nAll that encounter the mystery of God will realise the limitations of language and this will apply to both the cataphatic and apophatic way.",

		"content": "Principles of Kantian ethics\nNote that chapters 9 and 10 (p.125-141) in The Elements of Moral Philosophy are absolutely fantastic reading for discovering the nuances of Kant's arguments\n\nPrinciple\nExplanation\nMisc\n\nDuty\nKant believed that there was nothing good except good will. Nothing else matters: not the consequences of an action, not your emotions about an action, etc. We must be ethical because it is our duty to be ethical.\n&gt; This makes his theory deontological and absolutist.\n\nReason\nActing by feelings will lead to inconsistent morality — especially when acting for/against specific people.Acting teleologically is wrong because we do not know the effects our actions will have.&gt; Therefore we must always act with reason and with accordance of our duty.\nTeleologically is in accordance with purpose — telos=purpose.Also see the article below — it is good reading for Kant. To understand how he would respond is to understand many of his ideas.\n\nThe categorical imperative\n1. Universal law: a maxim must be able to be universalized. If you are not willing for anyone to do an action, you should not do it.2. Means to an end: one must never treat a person as a means only, always as an end. People should never be used for the sake of others to support some abstract ideal.3. Kingdom of ends: treat everyone as people for whom good must be done.4. Legislating member: you have to imagine that you create the rules and everyone will follow them.\nNote that the means to an end doesn't mean you can't use someone as a means — otherwise society wouldn't function. It's just that you must also treat them as an end at the same time.For understanding Kant's 'legislating member principle', read this article on the prisoner's dilemma. TLDR: Kant always picks the most virtuous option, no matter the opponent.\n\nthe hypothetical imperative\n'if you want to do well in your exams, you must study'. Hypothetical imperatives aren't on the same level as categorical imperatives.\nYou shouldn't really mention these in exams: they don't matter.\n\nImmortality and God\nKant noted that in order for there to be a reason for us to do our duty, we must be rewarded for our actions.&gt;This is through the summum bonum the place where all our happiness and virtue come together.&gt;&gt; This is not something achievable on earth — so it must be the afterlife.\nThis argument is then how he argues for the existence of God: a being who can arbitrate this reward.\n\nThree postulates of pure reason\nKant said that there were three conditions on reality that are necessary for his theory to work.1. We must have free will in order to make our own decisions2. There must be an afterlife so that we can achieve the summum bonum3. There must be a God in order for there to be a fair judge on who should achieve this.\nThis is a moral argument for the existence of God",

Only love does.\n\nFor example;\nFletcher gives the example of a family hiding from bandits when their baby starts crying- which would reveal where they are hiding.\nFletcher says that the most loving thing to do is to kill the baby, otherwise everyone else will die; including the baby.\nIsn't this just the trolley problem?\nThe four working principles\nThese are how to apply situation ethics/agape to ethics.\n\nPragmatism; an action must take into account the reality of the situation\nRelativism; all absolutes become relative to love.\n\nNot absolutizing the relative means that it is not total relativism where any moral claim could be justified. It is always relative to love which means that only moral claims which are valid when relative to love will be justified for Fletcher'\n\nPositivism; ethics has to have faith in love\nPersonalism; put people above the rules\n\n'The sabbath was made for man, not man for sabbath.'- Jesus.\n\nThe six fundamental principles\n\nlove is the only thing that is intrinsically good\nlove is the ruling norm in ethical decision making and replaces all laws\nlove and justice are the same thing: justice is love distributed\nlove wills the neighbour's good regardless of whether the neighbour is liked\nonly the end justifies the means; nothing else\nLove decides on each situation as it arises without a set of laws to guide it\n\nFletcher's views on Conscience\n\nFletcher thought that conscience was what enabled one to figure out how to apply agape in any situation.\nHe says that conscience is a verb, not a noun; indicating that he disagrees with the view that conscience is an internal moral compass/ the intuitive ability to tell right from wrong.\n\nStrengths and weaknesses of situation ethics\n\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\n\nPersonal — respects individuals and communities and what they value. Avoids detached ways of thinking.\nInterpretation — because it has no moral truths, morals are up to interpretation, which could lead to conflict.\n\nFlexible — able to adapt per situation\nInconsistent — changes on the situation so people don't have a easy way to know how to act.\n\nLove-based — love is great and tends to bring about happiness.\nWhat is love? — this is up for interpretation and further muddies the pot\n\nPeople-focussed — because it's based on love, it's focussed on the wellbeing of others\nHuman nature — people do not naturally act with love all the time\n\nGuidelines — still provides a framework for making moral choices\nConsequences — since it's teleological one has to consider all outcomes before acting: which can be very impractical.\n\nEvil — permits a person to carry out evil acts for a good result\n\nConscience — Fletcher's definition of conscience is reductionistic: most people review their actions afterwards to consider if they acted correctly\n\nGood isn't always right — sometimes 'bad' acts must be committed because they are the right thing to do.\n\nUnchristian — doesn't go by fundamental biblical principles.\n\nQuestions on Situation ethics\n• whether or not situation ethics provides a helpful method of moral decision-making\n• whether or not an ethical judgement about something being good, bad, right or wrong can be based on the extent to which, in any given situation, agape is best served\n• whether Fletcher’s understanding of agape is really religious or whether it means nothing more than wanting the best for the person involved in a given situation\n• whether or not the rejection of absolute rules by situation ethics makes moral decision-making entirely individualistic and subjective",

They all agree on the principle of utility, but they disagree on how they define 'good', and therefore they disagree on how to achieve it.\nIf you are going to use Utilitarianism in any essay, you are probably going to have to mention both, because they are quite different.\nOur two philosophers for this are <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/philosophy/02-ethics/ethical-systems/utilitarianism/#jeremy-bentham\">Bentham</a> and <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/philosophy/02-ethics/ethical-systems/utilitarianism/#john-stuart-mill\">J.S. Mill</a>\nPhilosopher's backgrounds\nJeremy Bentham\nBentham campaigned for legal and social reform in the late 1700s to early 1800s — specifically on slavery and women's rights. He came up with the principle of utility and the hedonistic calculus.\nHe believed that humans are psychological hedonists:\n\ni.e. we always seek our own pleasure\n\nJohn Stuart Mill\nJ.S. Mill was a liberal politician and social philosopher. He posited that all knowledge is based on experiences, and desires/beliefs are products of psychological laws.\n\nfor him, ethics was based on the desire of humans to be happy.\nHe also came up with the harm principle. This comes from his liberal ideas: it is that as long as one isn't doing harm,\n\nAct utilitarianism\nThis was Bentham's utilitarianism.\n\nit's teleological 🡺 whatever will bring about the most good\n\nHe had to define what good was. Because Bentham was a hedonist, he believed that pleasure=good/happiness\n\nfor him, the two are interchangeable.\n\nThe hedonic calculus\nHe then creates the hedonic calculus to determine how good an act is.\n\nIt uses various variables:\n\nintensity\nduration\ncertainty\npropinquity (how soon)\nfecundity (follow-on pleasure)\npurity of pleasure\nextent\n\nStrengths and weaknesses of Act\n\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\n\nGives a solid, repeatable method for evaluating situations\nNo type of action is ruled out if it's satisfying for a lot of people (Tyranny of the majority)\n\nhedonic calculus helps rationalise our decisions — it also accounts for pleasure in the long run over short term oain\ntakes too long to work out and is too subjective and how tf are you making ethics into maths\n\nit isn't dictatorial: allows for individual complexity in ethics\nnot everybody is a competent judge: allows for perception to cloud ethics too much\n\nonly thinks of the outcome\n\npleasure can be bad\n\nThe utility monster critique\nThis is directly copied from this web article by Jiajia Huang on the utility monster critique.\n\nThe Utility Monster theory is a hypothetical situation involving a hypothetical being called the Utility Monster and some cookies. From consuming each cookie, the Utility Monster produces much more “happiness” than the average person, thus being able to provide more happiness to the populace than the average person. So, following the tenets of utilitarianism, one would give the Utility Monster more cookies than the rest of the humans to produce the greatest output of happiness.\nHowever, the amount of cookies —a metaphor for human resources in this problem— is limited, which means that if the Utility Monster were to receive more cookies, cookies would have to be taken away from everyone else; thus reducing the happiness output of others.\nThis is obviously unfair as there is an imbalance between the cookies being doled out to the Utility Monster and any other person. Despite this act of unfairness, giving more cookies to the Utility Monster would still produce the greatest amount of utility for the populace and net happiness would be maximized. Still, others would lack resources —or in this case, cookies— and would have to suffer in exchange for greater net happiness. In order to increase net happiness, more people would have to suffer.\nThis is a drawback of utilitarianism. This philosophy of maximized happiness and utility will always be subject to those “utility monsters.” This raises the question, is net happiness and utility representative of true happiness and utility? You could say that a group’s utility is directly correlated to the utility of the least happiest person in said group.\nBut what is happiness and how can it be measured? Can it even be measured in the first place? Happiness varies from person to person and there is no concrete way to quantify the amount of happiness in an individual or a group.\nThis is why utilitarianism does not work as either a concept or a method of action. Utilitarianism centers around the maximization of happiness, something that can’t be properly measured and has no concrete unit. Furthermore, utilitarianism even goes so far as to contradict its own philosophy as seen with the example of the Utility Monster.\n\nRule utilitarianism\nMill disagreed with hedonism — he thought good is something other than pleasure.\n\nhe reformulated utilitarianism to reflect that good =/= pleasure, and that pleasures aren't all of equal value\n\nHe introduced the theory of utility — which replaced pleasure for happiness.\n\nHe defined happiness as something which is cultural and spiritual, and not just physical\n\nHe also distinguished between lower and higher pleasures.\n\nHigher and lower pleasures\nHe took a qualitative approach compared to Bentham's more quantitative approach.\nHe divided pleasures into higher and lower\n\nhigher pleasures were things such as poetry and music\nlower pleasures were things such as eating and drinking\n\n[!QUOTE]\n&quot;it is better to be a human satisfied than a pig dissatisfied.&quot;\n\nHis line of thought was similar to Epicureans: a group of intellectuals that thought mental pleasure &gt; bodily pleasure\n\nRules\nNote that Mill used the principle of utility not for individual situations, but to come up with rules for all of society: which are then followed. Mill is using the principle of utility as a method for discovering the best way of government: essentially just setting the goal as the principle of utility.\nStrengths and weaknesses of Rule\n\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\n\nLess relative: we won't have extremists doing things because their perception of pleasure is different to ours\nDecides which is higher and which is lower pleasures, when that is relative\n\nhigher pleasures do enrich life more than lower quality pleasures\nElitist: higher pleasures favour intellectuals: which is historically the upper class.\n\nalways know if you are being moral because it is deontological\nRule fetishism: prevents us from considering our actions because we just accept the rules- regardless of complexity of situations.\n\nOverall strengths and weaknesses\n\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\n\nA system which aims to create greater happiness for individuals/groups is attractive: and provides a simple aim to work for and unite around.&gt; This is the basis of liberalism: which was absolutely revolutionary at the time of it's creation\nIt's teleological 🡺 but we don't always know what will happen from an action.\n\nuniversal principle is important because we should go beyond our point of view\nwe can't judge whether people have acted morally or not.\n\nIt's an easy system to understand and implement.\nallows immoral actions for the sake of utility — like treating people as means not ends.\n\nIt wouldn't work if everyone was utilitarian (?)",

V. Brown</a> on if consensual acts are always morally justifiable.\n\n[!QUOTE]\n&quot;It is not clear to me that the activities of the appellants were exercises of rights in respect of private and family life. But assuming that the appellants are claiming to exercise those rights I do not consider that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights invalidates a law which forbids violence which is intentionally harmful to body and mind. Society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence. Pleasure derived from the infliction of pain is an evil thing. Cruelty is uncivilised. I would answer the certified question in the negative and dismiss the appeals of the appellants against conviction.&quot;\n\n[!QUOTE]\n&quot;That proposition can be expressed as follows: an assault intended or which is likely to cause bodily harm, accompanied by indecency, is an offence irrespective of consent, provided that the injury is not 'transient or trifling'.&quot;\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/pd-fs-and-articles/criminalisation-and-consent-r-v-brown/\">Criminalisation &amp; Consent -- R. V. Brown</a>\nUsing ethical systems to examine BDSM\nNatural moral law\nUtilitarianism\nFrom a utilitarian perspective, BDSM is okay when it produces more pleasure than harm.\n\nthis implies that all people involved are fully consenting, because a non-consenting person 'participating' in BDSM would produce more harm than pleasure.\nThis is a good example of a way to use the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/philosophy/02-ethics/ethical-systems/utilitarianism/#the-utility-monster-critique\">utility monster critique</a>\n\nSituation ethics\nKantian ethics\nThe major thing to focus on here is the conditions of the categorical imperative\n\nUniversalization of laws\n\nTheoretically, yes, BDSM can be universalized. If one defines consent as:\n\nfull knowledge of what will occur\ncapable of rationalizing this (i.e. adults/non-animals)\nfree from the pressure to agree or disagree\nfree to withdraw consent without pressure at any time\n\nThen you could definitely argue that — as long as all people involved have full consent — then yes, any BDSM act is perfectly fine.\n\nof course, one could argue that this allows for grievous/lasting bodily harm; however, I think anything with such lasting consequences is an event which is hard to have full knowledge/rationalise, then it still fits the definition\nOf course, you could argue that I am cherry picking — and that is a fair counter argument. However, I do think my definition can be applied universally, so I don't care.\n\nmeans to an end\n\nTreating everyone as an end in themselves? Easy! As long as one respects their partner and is not having sex: a) entirely for their own sexual pleasure, and b) whilst treating their partner only as a means and not as an end (which would disrespect their consent — as if you are treating someone as a means you don't care if they consent) then any sexual act is fine.\n\nKingdom of ends\nlegislating member\n\nThis one is only for use in actually acting out Kant's principles. If you've heard of the prisoner's dilemma, then Kantian ethics demands that one chooses the most virtuous option, no matter if your opponent is guaranteed to choose the option which hurts you.\n\nhere is an article on the prisoner's dilemma\n\nHomosexuality\nintroduction\nIt's likely that people at the time of the Bible thought about homosexuality in a completely different manner: the relationships between men and what was considered homosexuality wold have been completely different.\nKey terms\n\nboth of these words appear in the Bible, so it's important to know of them and their context.\n\nIf you want more info, look at Ben Wardle's dissertation on Biblical Exegesis/Hermeneutics\n\nterms for homosexuality\nArsenokoitai\n\nthis can be translated as homosexual relations, or it could be referred to as exploitative/paedophilia relations. It's unclear what it means, although it is definitely sexual\n\nMalakoi\n\nthis literally translates to 'soft/fine' (as in fine clothing.)\n\nIn the New Testament, it can be interpreted in various ways.\n\nsometimes moral weakness\nsometimes a form of effeminacy\nsome have argued that it's a passive partner in homosexual relations\n\nOther terms\n\n[!info] Exegesis\n'to explain' or 'to interpret' — specifically/especially an interpretation of the Bible.\n\nBible reading\nThousands of people have read/translated/transcribed/interpreted and used the Bible in countless ways\n\nthe Bible is a major source of authority for some Christians. For Theonomous Christians, it is the only source of authority (synoptic link to Christian Moral Principles.)\nWe have fragments of Greek Bibles from the first 400 years and the Latin remains afterwards\n\nMisquoting Jesus by Bart Ehrman is good reading for this. There's a YouTube playlist of the podcast recordings here\n\nTheology goes through many changes. The current age of academic theology is Postliberal Theology — which accepts exegesis, demythologisation, and narrative theology\nDifferent translations of the Bible have very different meanings; of which is often defined by the translator's own theology.\nMistranslations\nOn homosexuality\nOther mistranslations\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/pd-fs-and-articles/she-s-not-a-whore-translation-bias-in-ezekiel-16/\">She’s Not a Whore - Translation Bias in Ezekiel 16</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/pd-fs-and-articles/correcting-caricatures-women-in-the-bible/\">Correcting Caricatures - Women in the Bible</a>",

The focus on the woman's pleasure here —and the fact that these people are clearly having sex because they love each other — is revolutionary.\n\nDoes this text support a positive theology of sex — or is it still symbolic?\n\nIt's quite explicit. I'd have a hard time imagining how this is symbolic. You can't really symbolically suck someone's dick.\n\nHow might Song of Songs challenge Augustine or Kant\n\nFor Augustine, it's explicit sexual joy without need of procreation — sex for the sake of sex — which completely challenges his worldview. It's a touch more complicated for Kant, because he comes at it from an ethical perspective, but given how these two people clearly aren't just using each other as means to an end, I think Kant would be fine with it.\n\nAugustine: concupiscence and the shadow of lust\nText\n\n“(I) ran wild in the shadowy jungle of erotic adventures.”\n\n“Clouds of muddy carnal concupiscence filled the air; the bubbling impulses of puberty befogged and obscured my heart; I could not tell the difference between lust and love.”\n\nAnalysis\n\nConcupiscence: the post-lapsarian disordering of desire after The Fall.\nSex becomes linked to loss of rational control, moral instability, and misdirected love.\nFor Augustine, sexual desire is tainted not because bodies are bad, but because the will is damaged.\nOnly sex within marriage, ordered toward procreation, is morally tolerable — and even then tinged with the “sting of lust.”\nHis view underpins the traditional Christian suspicion of sex: sexual pleasure can enslave the will, obscure reason, and distract from God.\nPossible links: Natural Moral Law, ordo amoris, virtue/vice, telos, fallen nature.\n\nGuiding questions\n\nWhat is Augustine actually afraid of? Loss of reason? Misusing love? Disordered desire?\n\nHe is afraid of loss of control to his own desires, which are — according to him — inherently sinful after the Fall. Falling prey to his own desires undermines his relationship with God\n\nDoes Augustine's pessimism about lust undermine the possibility of positive Christian sexual ethics?\n\nAbso-fucking-lutely.\n\nHow does concupiscence explain Christian teachings around chastity, celibacy, and marriage?\n\nsince we are sinful because of the fall, especially around our desires for relationships (aka concupiscence), we must stay away from sex as much as possible so as to keep as close a relationship with God — however, marriage is safe because it is blessed by God, so one no longer needs to keep to chastity and celibacy. This is also why marriage is so important to Christians, because they want to fuck but can't unless they are married.\n\nKant: sex, objectification, and the moral law\nThe text\n\n“In loving from sexual inclination, they make the person into an object of their appetite. As soon as the person is possessed, and the appetite sated, they are thrown away, as one throws away a lemon after sucking the juice from it… Sexual desire drives us to ignore the humanity of our partners and to use them for our own purposes… Only monogamous marriage can make people formally committed to each other’s ends.”\n\nAnalysis\n\nSex is morally dangerous because it objectifies and treats people as mere means, violating the Categorical Imperative.\nKant believes sexual desire is so powerful that we will even consent to being treated as objects in exchange for our own gratification.\nOnly lifelong, monogamous marriage can create a relationship where both partners are committed to treating the other as an end in themselves.\n\nThis is one of the most negative accounts of sex in Enlightenment philosophy.\n\nBiographical gossip\n\nKant was obsessively routine-driven; locals joked they could set their clocks by his afternoon walk.\nHe wrote that sex is morally corrupting yet was rumoured (not proven) to have:\n\nfathered an illegitimate child with a servant;\nhad an unusually close relationship with his house-maid;\nlived with two bachelors known for libertine social lives in his youth.\n\nHistorical gossip, yes — but useful for debate: does Kant’s personal life destabilise his abstract ethics?\n\nGuiding questions\n\nIs Kant right that sexual desire is inherently objectifying?\n\nThis is false correlation. Just because sexual desire is often objectifying, does not mean that it is inherently objectifying.\n\nCan consent prevent objectification, or is Kant correct that reciprocity isn’t enough?\n\nIt's complicated. I objectification can't be retconned by the object consenting to being objectified.\n\nIs marriage the only context where sexual desire becomes morally permissible?\n\nI think this is just Kant being a product of his time, not because he has actual reasoning behind this.",

Annotate each passage and make notes on:\n\nHow each writer understands gender and its formation.\n\nPoints of similarity and difference.\n\nHow these ideas challenge traditional views of gender.\n\nExtracts\n\nWoman as “Other”\nBeauvoir – The Second Sex\n“One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine.”\nButler – Gender Trouble\n“Gender is the repeated stylization of the body, a set of repeated acts within a highly rigid regulatory frame that congeal over time to produce the appearance of substance — of a natural sort of being.”\n\nSocial Construction\nBeauvoir – The Second Sex\n“Thus humanity is male, and man defines woman not in herself but relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being. … He is the Subject, he is the Absolute — she is the Other.”\nButler – Gender Trouble\n“When the constructed status of gender is theorized as radically independent of sex, gender itself becomes a free-floating artifice, with the consequence that man and masculine might just as easily signify a female body as a male one, and woman and feminine a male body as easily as a female one.”\n\nThe Problem of Identity\nBeauvoir – The Second Sex\n“Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with absolute truth.”\nButler – Gender Trouble\n“There is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; … identity is performatively constituted by the very ‘expressions’ that are said to be its results.”\n\nReflection Questions\n\nWhat does Beauvoir mean by “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman”? How does this relate to Butler’s idea of gender as performative?\n\nBeauvoir means to say that society as a whole creates gender and enforces it onto women. Butler's is similar- but is more the idea that 'femininity' isn't real- it is women trying to express themselves through a rigid framework. Although Beauvoir's idea's are more signifying the 'second sex', meanwhile Butler says that gender identity isn't real in the first place.\n\nHow do both writers challenge the idea that gender is natural?\n\nboth writers put forward the idea that gender is created and not inherent- Beauvoir in that women are 'the second sex', which is a completely different idea to Christo-centric ideas of man and woman as two halves of the same whole. Butler goes further to say that gender is entirely constructed, and not inherent.\n\nWhere do you see Beauvoir laying the groundwork for Butler? Where does Butler go further?\n\nBeauvoir mostly talks about the oppression of women through our gender, that being oppressed is an inherent characteristic of being a woman. Butler goes further in fully saying that gender does not exist in the slightest, that it is nothing but a tool for oppression.\n\nHow might these ideas connect to debates today about gender identity and social roles?\n\nthey are both, quite radically, saying that gender does not exist at all AND that it is used as a tool for oppression. This is especially pertinent to the TERF ideology: of gender essentialism and anti-transgender rhetoric, which is (although not obviously, but still very strongly) related inherently to Butler's and Beauvoir's ideas. Because TERF's are 'protecting' gender essentialism, they are essentially the anti-feminists, and it is a misnomer to call them feminists at all, because they clearly do not understand <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/philosophy/03-dct/01-gender-and-society/feminism/\">Feminism</a>'s ideas.",

They assume a notion of a baptized continent, original sin is eradicated from your life, so they don't preach conversion.\n\nMost Liberation Theologians are actually social democrats, not communists. Capitalism is inherently reliant on greed, and it rewards greed — if greed is down, then the economy and therefore society suffers.\nCapitalism is not interested in religion — it only matters that the system keeps working.\nThe old testament is VERY interested in economics. It has many positive commandments. Hard work is valued (10-12 hours a day, 6 days a week working), but if people couldn't work, they were expected to be supplied for. They had checks and balances on someone being too greedy.\nLiberation Theologians do not ask for an actual system, just one that will prioritize human flourishing. We need to pay much attention to our discourse — and how they still affect the majority of people.\nThere is so much concentration of sin which separates you from God's law, from your neighbour. The structural dimension of salvation is necessary (see the freedom of the Jewish people in Egypt)- this was not from personal sin, but from structural sin.\nThere are three main denominations of LT- the one working within the Church, the ones that are still Christian but not beholden to the Church, and the post-christian.\nNeed to emphasize both personal and structural sin- Gutierrez believes in both but he does not elaborate on it.\nLiberation theologians emphasize the kingdom of God as inaugurated — but they put the now over the not yet.\nPope Francis I's first papal letter (the joy of the gospel) was a thorough critique of capitalism. 'how is it news when the stock market lowers by 2 points, but not when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure.' he also said 'this kind of economic system kills'\nRatzinger did not critique LT to justify not helping the poor. He explicitly said that it must not be taken as approval of 'those who keep the poor in misery, who profit from their misery, who notice it and do nothing about it, and those who are indifferent'.\n'the church, guided by the gospel of mercy and love for mankind hears the cry of justice, and intends to respond with all it's might",

When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.&quot; -Brazilian Archbishop Camara\nMajor points that need to be accounted for:\n\nTheme\nFor\nAgainst\n\nShould the church be political?\neverything is political- even not involving oneself in politics\nREFER TO PHILOSPHERS BELOW FOR ALL OF THESE.\n\nShould the church focus on the poor?\nOppression is intersectional. The poor are also most often also members of other oppressed groups- because the class system is used to oppress the oppressed.\n\nShould the church engage in political methodology?\nthe church does not focus on ruling- because they already have a king. They are just ambassadors for the kingdom of God.\n\nShould the church engage with the state?\nrefer to above.\n\nShould the church focus on structural sin rather than individual sin?\nStructural sin is the cause of individual sin. The thief only steals because he does not have enough money, etc.\n\nShould the church be more focussed on action or prayer?\nJesus rarely prays in the Bible: he acts to better society instead.\n\nDefinitions that need to be accounted for: (see later section)\n\nMarxism\nViolence (political violence/actualised violence/systemic violence)\nOppression- (do research into classism)\nLiberation theology\n\nPope John Paul 2nd\nPreferential option for the poor.\n&quot;Constant concern for and dedication to categories of people who are especially beloved to the Lord Jesus.&quot;\nHe went on to explain that the advancement of the poor constitutes a great opportunity for the moral, cultural, and economic growth for all of humanity.\nHowever, he makes it clear that: spiritual poverty can be caused by an over-emphasis on material goods and consumerism. It is right and proper for the church to concentrate on both spiritual and material matters.\nMarx and Restrepo\nRevolution begins with philosophers having solidarity with the oppressed.\nMarx thinks that the only way to cause change was through 'despotic inroads' (violence)\nThe 'preferential treatment for the poor' is indebted to Marx as it awakens the conscience of those in power to force the church into a struggle against injustice.\n'Words without action are empty. Revolution, even violence, may be needed in order to make the people free.' - Camilo Torres Restrepo\nIs it right for Christians to prioritise one group over another?\n\nYes, it is right\nNo, it is wrong\n\nBoff argues that God does not sit back, dispassionate and disengaged with the world, but gets involved, and sides with the poor.\nThe vatican claims that Liberation theology manifests a dangerous preoccupation with the poor and oppressed in Latin America. Although the poor should be helped, prioritising one group is wrong.\n\nGutierrez says that god: &quot;takes sides with the poor and liberates them from slavery and oppression [...] the reciprocal relationship between God and the poor person is the very heart of biblical faith.&quot;\nJesus' message was for all- we are all to be saved. Emphasising one group is dangerous because it forgets the universal nature of salvation.\n\nPoverty has a special status in Christianity- e.g. vows of poverty. It would be easier for a camel to go through an eye of a needle than for a rigch man to enter heaven, etc.\nJohn Paul 2 points to the idea that wealth does not shelter us from spiritual poverty. Rich people can be as unhappy as the poor.\n\nThe kingdom of heaven belongs to the oppressed- notably the poor. &quot;Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God&quot; (Luke) &quot;but woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort&quot; (also Luke)\nJesus does not idealise the poor. His aims for abundance are or everyone. He invites us to share what we have with the poor.\n\nThe church's concern with liberation theology\nThe church became concerned with liberation theology's use of Marx's theories and cardinal Ratzinger made the Church's disquiet known.\nSome felt that Marx's theories were the only immediate effective response but this could be dangerous.\n&quot;The Marxist ideology is wrong. But I have met many Marxists in my life who are good people, so I don't feel offended.&quot; - Pope Francis\nCritics\nKloppenburg (always a critic)\nHe has concerns. Here they are:\n\nLiberation theology emphasis practical opposition to oppression above the message of the gospels. Therefore the spiritual messages in Christianity are sidelined to focus on political action.\nIt emphasises structural sin over personal sin.\n\nJesus, however, reached into people's personal lives and spoke the the individual of coming back to God through forgiveness\n\nIt places too much emphasis on people delivering liberation and salvation- ultimately the kingdom of God is brought by God's intervention and salvation is a gift from God\n\nRichard McBrien\nIt could be argued that liberation theology is so concerned about action that it has not paid sufficient attention to christian theology. In starting from action it cannot determine which actions might be right or wrong.\nIt also defines oppression in economic terms, ignoring other kinds of oppression- e.g. sexism and racism.\nProponents\n\nfor starving people, liberation from personal sin isn't the most important\nThere isn't change happening for the people in our world who live in poverty- something must be done\neven if we agree that salvation and liberation is first about inner spiritual change, is there still not a point in which something must be done?\n\nShould Christianity engage with secularist atheist ideologies?\n\nYes\nNo\n\nChristianity has always adapted to new insights and borrowing from Marxism will not corrupt the religion.\nBoth theories have different approaches: Christianity is spiritual, Marxism is economic\n\nFor example, scientific advancement has led to the reconsideration of the story of genesis.\nMarxism explains how workers can liberate themselves by developing a socialist society\n\nIt has also led us to reconsider the healing stories in the new testament\nChristianity puts forward the idea of a world created by a loving God. Humans turn away from God and God's response is to seek people to bring back to him by sending his son.\n\nGod can be encountered in all things- including human thought: making &quot;christian Marxism&quot; possible\nIf Christianity were to adopt elements of Marxism (which isn't in biblical cannon)- it would abandon the christian worldview\n\nBut even if Marxism and Christianity can be compatible, perhaps we should not adopt it wholescale.\n\nBoff thinks that liberation for Christians must draw from the Gospel and Marxism must not be a central principle. He says that Marxism focusses on a socialist system that denies God and individual dignities.\n\n&quot;Marx is a useful companion on the way, but there is only one teacher: Jesus Christ.&quot;\n\nBonino thinks that the Marxist scheme cannot be taken as a dogma, but rather as a method which has to be applied to our own reality in the terms of our reality\n\nGustavo Gutierrez (VIP)\n\nGutierrez, a Peruvian priest, mentions Marx's theories of alienation and exploitation. Not surprisingly, he warned against adopting all of Marx's teachings.\nGutierrez did, however, feel that the people of Latin America had a deep rooted desire to get rid of capitalism.\n\nHe felt that the Church should stand with political groups on this\n\nHe felt that it is through 'praxis' that the poor are helped and that true knowledge of God comes through living with and helping the poor\n\nPraxis- the process by which a theory/lesson/skill is enacted, applied, realised, and/or put into practice.\n\nFor Gutierrez, to not get involved is sinful because you are keeping the situation as it is. He feels that the church in Latin America has no choice but to speak out.\n\n&quot;Surely the unity of the church cannot tolerate class struggle. Surely the aim is a socialist society: more just and more human.&quot;\n\nHowever, theologian Miroslav Volf argued theology and theory has to come first.\n\nSummary of my ideas\nDefinitions\n\nSeparating the definitions of violence into 'physical violence' (hitting someone, etc) and 'political violence' (having health insurance claims denied, refusing to give one's labour (in the form of strikes/refusal based on characteristics) which then leads to others suffering, etc)\n\nMarxism's main points of interest are:\n\nactions are what matter: changing society must be up to philosophers to not just interpret, but also act on their interpretations.\nClass as a system is used to oppress the poor on a systemic level\nThe only way to overcome this is through violent revolution\nPost-revolution, there are directions/methods that he writes of for how the state should be run/exist\nthis society should be atheist\n\nLiberation theology\n\nthis is not one single, organised idea. The particulars tend to change based on philosophers- specifically on:\n\nif violence is acceptable when doing this (only Restrepo is a proponent)\nhow far one should go with this (Pope John Paul II at the lower end, Gutierrez at the higher end.)\n\n‘Liberation theology compromises Christian faith by aligning too closely with Marxism’\nMy main line of argument is that while liberation theology is certainly influenced by, or perhaps kickstarted by Marxism: they are fundamentally different ideologies: not even in the same category of ideology: Marxism is political methodology, meanwhile Liberation theology is an ethical idea.\nTLDR: it doesn't compromise christian faith because it does not align with Marxism.\nThemes of my argument\n\nTheme\nPoint\n\nViolence\nPhysical violence is not condoned by the Bible- and neither is it by the majority of Liberation theologians: because it is not in the Bible. However, political violence is condoned by both. (needs more research)\n\nPolitics\nSome argue that the church shouldn't be involved in politics. This is a moronic idea- everything is inherently political. There is no such thing as not being political: even saying that oneself will not be political is political: because it means you will not stand in the way of injustices of others simply because it is convenient for you to ignore it. Also, saying that Jesus/the Bible wasn't political is fucking stupid.\n\nPolitical methodology\nLiberation theology's major difference with Marxism is that it does not illustrate methods of revolution- it simply points out that injustice is systemic and something must be done about that. It is more pointing out that the church should stand with those who fight against systemic injustice, rather than a methodology for how to overturn a state.\n\nTheology\nSome argue that Christianity should be more focussed on prayer and theology. I don't particularly see where they got this from, because Jesus certainly didn't pray that much; he acted. Whether it was riding into Jerusalem on a donkey, flipping over tables at a bank, supporting the poor and oppressed through his actions. Any prayer he does do is accompanied by action. Why would Christians not act? All of Jesus' teachings are on how to act, not how to pray.\n\nPreferential option for the poor\nSome argue that we should not show specific preference for the rights of the poor; because salvation comes to everyone. This is ignorant of the fact that wealth is used as a tool against the oppressed of all kinds so that they stay oppressed in a systemic manner. Women weren't allowed bank accounts until the 60's, pink tax, racist bias in hiring (meaning that people of colour can't get higher paying jobs), the american government not providing financial aid during the HIV/AIDS pandemic (because it was contracted by mostly homosexuals)- things like this meant to keep oppressed groups oppressed. This is also known as political violence.\n\nSystemic sin v individual sin\nSome argue that Jesus focussed more on individual sin rather than the sins that are systemic: so therefore we should do that too. This ignores the fact that Jesus lived in a time where political theory (such as the one of systemic injustice) was not widespread knowledge- and also in a time where life was incredibly different; 95% of the population were farmers or in some other manual labour; stocks didn't exist; rent didn't exist; globalism didn't exist; people only knew people who lived nearby, etc. Systemic injustice was (while still absolutely a big thing at the time) not as widespread or as inescapable as it is today. To pretend like one shouldn't adapt to the times is moronic. Also; Jesus was intended to become king- which absolutely would not have been dealing with sin on an individual level!",

}Approach to interpreting the BibleThe propositional viewThe Bible is pureRevelation -- theinfallible truth.The non-propositional viewThe Bible's messagesshould be adapted toone's own life.All ethics and morality aredetermined by God's commandsWriters of the Bible arescribes of God's wordThe Bible is self-authenticating and infallibleDoes not requireinterpretationAs the word of God, it's the onlysource of moral decision making.Karl BarthGod's word cannot befully captured in humanlanguage: the Biblecannot claim to literallyrepresent his message.Only God is divine -- not a book.Richard HayWe must read the Biblehermeneutically -- interpretingtexts whilst keeping in mindthe context in which theywere written.Friedrich SchleiermacherThe hermeneutical circle:a person must read a passagewithin the context of theBible and then in the contextof one's life.Are theonomous ethics useful?Clear: taking scripture as thewhole truth provides clearguidance on moral matters.Therefore it's

The top rate of taxation was 83%\n\nNew Labour\n\nIn the 1979 general election, James Callaghan was defeated by the Conservative Party led by Margaret Thatcher. Following the election of Michael Foot as Labour leader in 1980, the party moved decisively to the left. In the 1983 general election Labour’s manifesto committed the party to further nationalisation, increased taxation of the wealthier in society, withdrawal from the European Economic Community and unilateral nuclear disarmament. One Labour MP, Gerald Kaufman, famously referred to the manifesto as ‘the longest suicide note in history’ and Labour’s share of the vote collapsed from 36.9% in 1979 to 27.6% in the 1983 general election, handing Thatcher a landslide victory.\n\nThe scale of the 1983 general election defeat shocked Labour into abandoning its most socialist policies and, under the leadership of Neil Kinnock (1983–92) and John Smith (1992–94), Labour moved towards the centre.\n\nThen TONY FUCKING BLAIR WAS ELECTED.\nThe third way\nBlair loved the 'third way' principles developed by Anthony Giddens.\nAccording to Giddens, the third way represented a compromise between the extreme socialism and capitalism. It argued that Labour governments should not commit to ideological commitments such as nationalisation, redistributive taxation, class conflict, collectivism and equality.\nInstead, Labour should focus on the establishment of a 'stakeholder society', based on the principles of inclusion and communitarianism.\n\nEssentially, enacting policies that encourage:\n\nWealth creation rather than wealth distribution\nLoosening ties with trade unions\nSocial justice within a capitalist economy.\nBlair modified the Labour party constitution in 1995 so that the party abandoned its commitment to nationalisation and accepted the economic benefits of a free-market economy.\n\nThe left wing of the party fucking hated him.\nHere's what he did:\n\nKept the top tax rate at 40% as established by Thatcher, because 'the wealthiest in society are wealth creators' (bruh)\nThe state was an enabler, not a provider. State schools were given greater independence and tuition fees were introduced so that students contributed to the cost of higher education\nIntroduced tough laws such as 'anti-social behaviour orders' (ASBOs) to combat crime\nConstitutional modernisation-\n\nRemoving most hereditary peers\nIncorporating the ECHR\nEstablishing the Supreme Court\nDevolution\n\nIntroduced a minimum wage, and increased spending on public services.\n\nWhen Blair resigned in 2007, Brown became PM. In response to the 2008 economic crisis, he introduced a 50 pence top rate of taxation on incomes over £150, 000, as well as a bank bailout programme.\nHis successor, Ed Miliband, maintained it's distancing from Blairite policy by committing to the 50 p top rate of taxation, demanding an energy price freeze, and drawing a distinction between 'predatory' finance capitalism and 'producers' in the industry.",

It's based around the idea of wanting stability above all else.\nThis means no violence, stable economy, and avoiding a revolution by appeasing the peasants (lol)- A.K.A keep things the same at all times.\n\nOne-nation conservatism\n\nFounded by Benjamin Disraeli.\nHe thought that conservatism must unite the nation in reverence for traditions and institutions that made Britain great.\nHe saw society as an organic body in which stability and prosperity could be achieved through everyone appreciating their debt to each other, and not putting their selfish interests above the wellbeing of the community.\nHe warned against Britain becoming two nations- a nation of the rich and a nation of the poor.\nThis led to conservatives supporting extensive social reforms (such as the welfare state.)\nThey became the most successful modern vote-winning political party and the main governing party most of the 20th century.\nPMs include Stanley Baldwin, Harold Macmillan, and Edward Heath (1970-74)\n\nThe new right\n\nby the 1970s, the effectiveness of one-nation conservatism was undermined by large-scale industrial unrest. Trade unions were increasingly demanding higher wages, challenging the principle that a Conservative government could effectively unite all sections of society.\n\nIn 1975, Maggie Thatcher defeated Heath for leadership, and established the new right- also known as 'Thatcherite' principles.\nThe new right is a combination of neo-liberalism and neo-conservatism.\n\nit was neo-liberal because (unlike it's predecessor) it supported the free market to the extreme.\n\nessentially that the job of government was to make conditions as favourable as possible for the successful operation of the free market\n\nAdam Smith referred to this as the 'invisible hand of the market\n\nIt thought that governments should do this by:\n\nKeeping taxation to a minimum\nreducing inflation and interest rates\ndiscouraging a 'dependency culture' created by the welfare state\n4. limiting the influence of trade unions because they disrupt the smooth operation of the free market\n\nit was neo-conservative because it was strongly connected to authoritarianism- and fear of disorder (which disrupts stability)\n\nThey did this through:\n1. discouraging permissive and alternative lifestyles that threatened the nuclear family\n\ngiving the government extensive power to fight crime and disorder\nprotecting national interest by having a strong defence policy\nemphasising the nation state as the source of the citizen's security\n\nthis meant that they were sceptical of the EU.\n\n[!info] Liz Truss\nTruss' policies (specifically, cutting the rate of taxation) were credited to Thatcherite credentials. After all, in Howe's first budget, he drove down the top rate of income tax 83%-&gt;60% and the basic rate 33%-&gt;30%. However, Thatcher wasn't all tax-cuts; she definitely balanced the budget. A later Howe budget dramatically increased indirect taxes to drive down the deficit- in contrast to Truss' 2022 claim that it was the 'right time' for the government to borrow more.\nKwarteng's 'give away budget'- which cut the base rate of income tax, removed the increase in national insurance and froze corporation tax-- had more in common with Heath's budgets than Thatcher's.\nSo although Truss may have come into office laying claim to Thatcher’s legacy, her policies had a distinctly Heath-ite flavour. Rishi Sunak's balancing of the budget was much truer to Thatcher's legacy.\n\nModern Conservative policy\nThe economy (one-nation/Thatcherite)\nThe Tories tend to flip-flop between one-nation and Thatcherite on the economy: even within the same government.\n- Johnson's government had high public spending to level up society.\n- Public spending in 2021 was 42% of the economy, on par with the 1970s\n- (although note that some of this was definitely COVID)\n- To finance increased spending, Chancellor Sunak significantly increased corporation tax and national insurance\n- Truss' government was... a fucking mess\n\nSunak's government responded to the recession with higher taxes and dramatic cuts in public spending- a very Thatcherite thing.\n\nWelfare (one-nation/Thatcherite)\n\nWhen the minimum wage was introduced by Blair, Tories claimed it was unacceptable.\nIn Cameron's government, Chancellor Osborne introduced a 'living wage' to provide extra support for the least well paid\nJohnson established a new secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities.\n\nBut he also measurably privatised the NHS\n\nCameron, Truss, and Sunak all said that they were committed to supporting the NHS.\n\nHowever, the Universal Credit system, which is based on more you earn= less you get in benefits suggests Thatcherism.\n\nLaw and order (Thatcherite)\n\nMay passed the 'Investigatory Powers Act' (2016) giving the government enhanced powers of surveillance.\nJohnson passed the 'Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act' which increased police powers over public protests.\n\nThe home secretaries- Priti Patel and Suella Braverman, were both critics of liberalism..\n\nForeign policy (Thatcherite)\n\nJohnson negotiated Brexit.\n\nhe also announced a £16.5 billion increase to defence spending, the biggest boost since the end of the Cold war\nin 2021, the UK joined (AUSUK), a defence alliance to counter China.\n\nTruss and Sunak were similarly hawkish- providing strong opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and criticising China for it's human rights record\n\nKemi Badenoch\nIn the 2024 election manifesto:\n\nhalve migration by implementing a cap\n\ncontinuing the Rwanda policy\n\nnational service program for 18-year-olds\nAfterwards:\nrepealing the Human Rights Act\nwithdrawing from the ECHR\nrepealing the climate change act\nreversing tax changes introduced by Starmer",

In the 2019 election, the Tory 'get Brexit done' message was very popular with voters.\nHowever, the existence of safe seats, state of the economy, or long-term voter trends are often more important than a campaign.\nLabour's sweep in 2024 was largely due to public dissatisfaction with the Conservative government, not due to their campaign.\nRational choice model\nThe rational choice model posits that voters vote based on their self-interests and policies advocated by political parties.\nValance Issues\nIssues where there is a broad consensus among voters what is good — such as a strong economy, the NHS, or national security.\nThe election then becomes about which party can deliver better outcomes.\nSalient issues\nIssues that are important to voters at the time, which tend to change election on election. For example — Brexit in 2019, or now immigration.\nTrack record\nTrack record in government or actions of a candidate. This is more of a concern for the incumbent candidate. We can see this in how the Conservatives lost horribly in the 2024 election.\nLeader and party image\nA charming leader is more appealing. Take Blair and Johnson. Or nowadays, Reform is entirely coasting by on the popularity of Farage.\nManifesto\nThe media only covers the main points or the controversial policies. Most of the time they don't matter, but take Theresa May's 'dementia tax.'\nVoting Context model\nThe voting context model is similar to the rational choice model, but is more to do with the external factors of a particular election than individual's choices.\nTactical voting\nIndividuals strategically vote for a candidate or party to prevent the election of a less preferred candidate/party.\nProtest voting\nIndividuals that cast their vote as a form of protest or to express dissatisfaction with the political system or other things.\nBy-elections\nElections held to fill a vacant seat in a legislative body, occurring between general elections. Almost entirely used to show dissatisfaction with the current government. (Take reform's fucking sweep in council elections.)\nOpinion polls\nRefer below.\nBandwagon effect\nPhenomenon where the popularity of a candidate convinces others to vote for them — often based off of opinion polls.\nBoomerang effect\nPhenomenon where negative attacks on a candidate result in increased support for them. (Trump.)\nOpinion Polls\nWhy are Opinion polls conducted?\n\nUnderstanding public opinion\nShaping political campaigns\nInforming media coverage\nSupporting academic research\nEngaging the electorate\n\nTypes of opinion polls\n\nVoting intention\nLeadership approval\nExit polls\nTracking polls (a. k. a. issue/opinion)\nMRP (multilevel regression and post-stratification) (predicts how a constituency votes.)\nMRPs predicted Johnson breaking through the Red Wall.\n\nDo opinion polls affect voting behaviour?\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/essay-plans/politics-essay-plans/do-opinion-polls-affect-voting-behaviour/\">Do opinion polls affect voting behaviour</a>\n\nYes\nNo\n\nPolls can create a bandwagon effect. For instance, in the 2019 GE, polls predicting a significant Tory lead may have convinced undecided voters to back them, or convinced opposed voters to not vote, convinced a Tory victory was inevitable.\nMany voters make decisions based on things other than polls. The 'Red Wall' shift in 2019 was caused by long-term dissatisfaction with Labour's stance on Brexit and economic policies.\n\nMedia coverage amplifies poll's importance — take Reform's current showing in the polls and showing in Media.\nPolls are only paid attention to by those who follow politics and elections closely. For instance, polls in 2024 showing shifts in younger voter turnout became focal on social media — and young voter turnout dropped from ~47%-&gt;~37%.\n\nPolls can mobilise voters who fear that their preferred party is trailing. For example, in the 2019 GE, polling data suggested a possible hung parliament, potentially motivating Tory voters to turn out.\nThe majority of voters have a preference before campaigns begin, so polls have little impact. In 2019, Scotland continued to back the SNP despite polling trends.\n\nStrategic voting can be influenced by polls, especially in marginal constituencies. For example, in the 2024 GE, polling data highlighted tight races in the South East, leading calls for Lib-Dem voters to vote for Labour in key constituencies to unseat Tory MPs.\nInaccurate or poorly conducted polls can be misleading. In 2024, a widely shared (but flawed) poll underestimated Labour's performance in the Midlands, creating false expectations of a conservative hold in marginal seats.\n\nPolling data from 2017-2025",

		"content": "Class\nSocio-economic class\nThis refers to the categorisation of people based on income, occupation, and social status. Traditionally, these have been working, middle, and upper class. However, nowadays it is much more complicated.\nIn the UK, classes are now grouped as:\n\nAB: Higher managerial/professional roles\nC1: lower managerial/professional roles\nC2: skilled manual workers\nDE: semi-skilled and unskilled workers, unemployed, or retired\nObviously, the job descriptions for all of these can be very inaccurate when determining class. It's a generalist approach, not a 100% correct one.\n\nSocio-economic class historically played a large role in voting behaviour. The commonly held views on how class affects voting behaviour are as follows:\n\nLabour appeals to C2DE voters because it appeals to the working class by funding a welfare state and supporting worker's rights\nConservatives appeal to ABC1 voters because their policies favour low taxes and businesses\nNowadays, these assumptions aren't really correct for multiple reasons.\n\nFactors associated with class alignment of voters\n\nFactor\nExplanation\nExamples\nWhy it can not have an impact\n\nClass identification\na.k.a class conciousness — how one's sense of belonging to a class can influence voting behaviour.\nIn 2019, some working-class Leave/Labour voters felt neglected by Labour, contributing to Tory gain.\nClass identification has weakened due to broader societal changes, including globalisation (hard to think you're doing crap when you see mass genocide/starvation.)\n\nClass dealignment\nrefers to weakening of traditional associations between class and party — leading to greater electoral volatility.\nIn 2019, Tories attracted C2 voters by focusing on Brexit. In 2024, Labour attracted Tory-leaning middle-class voters because of economic dissatisfaction transcending class identity.\nWhile it provides opportunity for change, parties still rely on traditional bases. Although class dealignment was prominent in 2019 for Labour, they won them back in 2024, demonstrating that this is volatile.\n\nPartisan dealignment\nrefers to weakening of voter loyalty to specific parties — leading to an increase in floating voters.\nTories winning in 'Red Wall' constituencies in 2019, rise in Issue-Based voting (Labour on cost of living in 2024), rise in smaller parties, more tactical voting in marginal constituencies.\nit seems like this has an incredible impact. Lower party membership across the board, broad dissatisfaction with Labour and the Conservatives... yeah.

Many focus almost entirely on digital news, now.\nAssessment of the impact of print media\n\n2019 election — despite the decline, print media reinforced political divisions. The Sun's anti-Corbyn campaign solidified tory support.\n2024: not much impact on younger voters. However, the Daily Mail's endorsement of Tories may have swayed older voters.\n\nTelevision\n\n[!info] Statistics on TV\n79% of the adult population use television as their main source for accessing the news.\n93% of adults aged 65+ use television to access the news.\n89% of 16–24-year-olds report that their main source of news is the internet.\n85% of minority ethnic people access news from the internet rather than television.\n\nBroadcast TV\nTV is subject to strict regulations to ensure impartiality, enforced by Ofcom.\n\nBroadcasters must provide balanced coverage of political parties\nPolitical advertising on TV and radio is prohibited. Instead, parties receive free airtime for Political Party Broadcasts (PPBs) which must also meet impartiality requirements.\n\nPrint media faces no such obligations. The Sun could openly support the Conservatives in the last two elections, but the BBC and ITV are required to present balanced debates and coverage of all major parties.\nThe rise of 24-hour news channels\n\nThese channels provide continuous coverage of breaking news, political events, debates, and election results\n\nDuring the 2019 GE, Sky ran extended analyses on Brexit's implications\n\nBy 2024, 24-hour news channels face increased competition from online platforms, but they remain key for real-time election updates.\n\nIn more recent years, TV debates and interviews have become more important. See Clegg's performance in a debate before the 2010 election, possibly leading to the coalition.\nWho watches TV?\n\nOlder demographics (50+) are the primary consumers of live broadcast news\nYounger demographics favour clips of broadcast shared on social media.\n(Something something the fact that clips will be designed to get a reaction on social media means that only the most controversial clips will go viral.)\n(also it's just going to go into your echo chamber.)\n\nThe rise of opinion news\nYeah it's GB news. They do a LOT of social media work. Also, it isn't impartial in the slightest.\nChanging preferences\nAccording to Ofcom, more adults are getting their news online (71%) rather than from TV (70%). Among The Kids, its even more pronounced — 88% of 16-24 use online sources, with only 49% using TV.\nAlthough the BBC still reaches 68% of adults in the UK.\nAssessment of importance of traditional media\nBroadcast continues to play a large role in shaping voting behaviour and public opinion.\n\nAgenda setting: TV frames key election issues. In 2019, the BBC and Sky prioritized Brexit coverage.\nTrust: despite criticism, the BBC is still regarded as more trustworthy than social media or print outlets\nPolarisation: the rise of opinion news may have contributed to increased polarisation, although their viewership remains small in comparison to major broadcasters.\n\nYes, it has declined\nNo, it hasn't\n\nYounger voters increasingly gain political information from social media. In 2024, platforms like TikTok reached a third of young Britons.\nDuring the 2019 UK general election, social media algorithms often promoted content that reinforced users’ existing beliefs, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives.\n\nNewspapers have dramatically declined in circulation in recent years. Between 2010 and 2019, major UK newspapers experienced significant drops in print circulation, prompting many to invest heavily in their online presence to retain readership.\nDespite the rise of social media, traditional media remains a primary news source for many voters, especially older demographics who have higher voter turnout rates. In the 2019 UK general election, traditional outlets online were the most popular for general election news, indicating that traditional media still played a significant role in informing voters.\n\nOn-demand services and content apps like Netflix mean live viewing of TV (24-hour news or scheduled news programming) has decreased, leading people to not tune into TV news. By 2024, more British people got their news from the internet (71%) than from television (70%), marking a significant shift in news consumption habits.\nMany newspapers have successfully transitioned to digital formats, maintaining or even expanding their readership through online platforms. By 2024, newspapers like The Guardian and The Times had substantial digital subscriber bases, allowing them to continue shaping political narratives and influencing voter opinions.\n\nCitizen journalism and the curation of news content mean people are pushed the news they want and agree with and won’t search it out from established sources such as the press and broadcast TV.\nTraditional media outlets provide editorial standards and fact-checking that help ensure the accuracy and reliability of information, which can counterbalance the echo chamber effect of personalised news feeds. In the 2024 UK general election, traditional media continued to serve as a counterbalance to the echo chambers of social media, offering fact-checked and comprehensive coverage that reached a broad audience.\n\nNew media — social media and online sources\nThe shift from print to digital media has sped up news delivery, creating a 24/7 news cycle that’s constantly updated online.\n\nNowadays, people mainly get their news from websites and social media platforms like Twitter. This allows them to choose their own sources of information, which can reinforce their personal biases.\nSocial media lets politicians communicate directly with the public, bypassing traditional media channels. This has changed the way political communication works.\n“Filter bubbles” on social media encourage users to engage with like-minded opinions and demonise opposing ones, reinforcing partisan views.\nA small, vocal minority on social media can significantly influence public discourse and mainstream media agendas, contributing to societal polarisation.\nWhile social media provides instant access to information, it also fosters division and hostility, affecting how people perceive each other and political figures.\n\nMisinformation\nA report by the University of Oxford highlighted that organised social media manipulation campaigns were identified in 81 countries, including the UK. This was a 15% increase from the previous year.\nDuring the 2019 GE, the Tory press office rebranded it's twitter account as 'factcheckUK' during a leader's debate.\nAdditionally analysis revealed that 88% of the Conservative Party's Facebook advertisements during a specific period contained misleading information, compared to 0% of the Labour party.\nAlso, deepfakes.\n\nStatistics\n\n1 in 4 say they get most of their news on political matters on social media.\nSocial media is the primary political news source for 58% of those aged under 35, compared with 8% of those aged 55+\n\nEcho chambers\n\n43% of those who get their political news from social media say they often come across views online with which they disagree\n\n16% say that they 'rarely' or never do so.\n\n35% of those who get their news from traditional media say they often encounter views online with which they disagree\n54% of social media users say they often consult a second source when looking for news, while 36% say they often do so by checking a source that they do not often use\nOnly 53% of social media news receivers think that it is a reliable source. 44% feel that it is unreliable.\n\nPolarisation\n\n32% of social media users have a low level of trust in the courts, compared with 26% of those who primarily obtain their political news from other sources\n54% of social media users have a low level of trust in Parliament, compared with 49% of those who get most of their news from other sources\nNearly one in three social media users (32%) are either very libertarian or very authoritarian in outlook, compared with just over one in four (27%) of other users\n32% of social media users voted in the 2024 election for either Reform (20%) or the Greens (12%), eleven points above the figure for other users\n25% of social media users hold very ‘left-wing’ views compared with only 14% of other users. But only 8% have a very ‘right-wing’ outlook, compared with 13% of other users\n30% of social media users are either very sympathetic or very unsympathetic towards welfare, the same proportion as among other users\n\nIs social media's influence overstated?\n\nYes, it is overstated\nNo, it is understated\n\nSocial media reinforces political beliefs by pushing content voters already agree with, so doesn’t change minds, justifies existing positions. During the 2019 UK general election, social media algorithms often promoted content that reinforced users’ existing beliefs on issues like Brexit, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives.\nSocial media platforms have the potential to expose users to a wider range of viewpoints, which can influence and change voting behaviour. In the 2024 UK general election, political parties utilised social media to reach undecided voters, employing targeted advertising to present policy positions to those not firmly aligned with a particular party.\n\nDespite the rise of online news consumption, traditional media outlets remain influential, especially among demographics with higher voter turnout. In the 2019 UK general election, traditional media outlets continued to play a significant role in informing voters, particularly older demographics who are more likely to vote.\nSocial media has become the number one source for news; 71% of all voters get their information from online sources. By 2024, more British people got their news from the internet (71%) than from television (70%), marking a significant shift in news consumption habits.\n\nThis influence declines the higher up the age brackets you go, with older voters preferring broadcast media. Older voters have shown a preference for traditional broadcast media, relying on television and radio for their news consumption.\nThe gap is narrowing as older demographics increasingly adopt online platforms for news consumption. By 2024, there was a noticeable increase in older voters engaging with news content online, indicating a shift in media consumption habits across age groups.\n\nA lot of evidence suggests that trusted and well-sourced news is important to voters, and traditional media like the press are still able to set the agenda due to targeting age groups that have higher levels of turnout.\nInformation and news have been democratised on social media, allowing free access rather than requiring the purchase of a newspaper or subscription. Social media platforms provide users with free access to a vast array of news sources, reducing barriers to information.\n\nTraditional media outlets have maintained their agenda-setting power, particularly among demographics with higher voter turnout.\nSocial media platforms are increasingly influential in setting the news agenda, especially among younger voters who are more active online. In the 2024 UK general election, social media trends and discussions played a significant role in shaping political discourse, particularly among younger demographics.\n\nSocial media has a symbiotic relationship with traditional media, with posts and content shared on platforms like TikTok and X coming from content newspapers and broadcast media created. Content from traditional media outlets is frequently shared and discussed on social media platforms, indicating a symbiotic relationship between the two.\nSocial media platforms also generate original content that influences traditional media coverage, highlighting a bidirectional relationship. During the 2024 UK general election, viral content originating on social media platforms often prompted coverage and discussion in traditional media outlets.",

The way that this is different to English devolution is that for England, power is given out from in — whereas in the USA it goes in from out.\n\nIn the UK, power given out is uneven.\n\nWhy is america federal?\n\nHistorically 13 colonies- it was easy to carry on like that\nThe USA is very diverse in population, culture, and climate\nIt was seen as a good way of spreading power and minimising the chance of tyranny.\n\nIf there is any questions on whether something is a federal thing or a state thing- it is assumed to be a state power.\n\nThe idea that power resides with the states is codified by the tenth amendment.\n\nThis has resulted in the US developing a strong culture of localism and regionalism- which is common in the UK devolved bodies but less so in England.\n\nHow has federalism changed over time?\n1.      Dual federalism- 1790s--1930s\nThe federal and state governments were very separate. The federal government is seen as intrusive. Tension over states rights led to the civil war over slavery. After the civil war, there is a period of reconstruction but there is still a shit ton of racist laws in the south.\n2.      Co-operative federalism- 1930s-1960s\nIn ’29, the wall street crash causes the great depression. The US economy shrunk a shit ton. Then Roosevelt took control of large parts of the economy- i.e. publicization.\nSo he does the New Deal using the commerce clause- he is pushing it. The supreme court is anti-New Deal- but in 1937 he threatens to increase the number of court justices and flood the court with democrats.\n3.      New federalism- 1960s- 2000s\nThe federal government was being seen as inefficient- conservativism is on the rise- many white southerners and deeply unhappy about policies that aren’t racist.\nThen Nixon offers block grants to states to solve problems- but they don’t have to reach a goal or something. so they are given more autonomy.\n4.      Who the fuck knows- 2000s-now\nEveryone -starting with Bush- has changed it the fuck around.\n2000s federalism onwards\n\npresident\nDevelopment of state power\nDevelopment of federal power\n\nGeorge Bush\n&gt;Gonzales v Oregon (2006)- effectively allowed state-sponsored euthanasia&gt;Medicaid waiver given to Massachusetts to allow Governor Romney to introduce a new universal health programme.\n&gt;USA PATRIOT act 2001- allowed federal government to detail people and collect information about them&gt;homeland security- whole new cabinet department&gt;No child left behind act 2002- allowed for uniform school testing\n\nBarack Obama\n&gt;PPACA- known as Obamacare (2010)- at the state’s urging, Obamacare including power over the provision of medical insurance run by the states themselves&gt;Texas v United States (2016) the supreme court struck DAPA (deferred action for parents of Americans) due to cost to states.&gt;The Cole memo- the justice department said it wouldn’t enforce federal restrictions on marijuana when states had legalised it.\n&gt;Obamacare&gt;Arizona v United States- overturned a law in Arizona that increased state law enforcement power to enforce immigration laws&gt;Obergefell v Hodges (2015)- the supreme court effectively legalised same sex marriage nationally\n\nDonald Trump\n&gt;Carpenter v United States (2018)- the supreme court found that the federal government must obtain a warrant for a citizen’s cell phone location records&gt;Executive order minimizing the economic burden of PPACA- aimed at reversing Obamacare and giving states more control\n&gt;The Cole memo was rescinded&gt;executive order stripping federal grants from ‘sanctuary cities’ (later found to be unconstitutional\n\nJoe Biden\n&gt;abortion and heartbeat bills- up to the states&gt;Covid-19 rules\n&gt;Build Back Better plan- a three part plan which had big spending on Covid-19 recovery\n\nDonald Trump\nIdk voting 'rights'?&gt; OMG his trying to rescind SNAP payments!\n&gt;the executive order on tariffs and birthright citizenship\n\nIs the USA federal today?\n\nYes\nNo\n\nThe supreme court seems very willing to return important decisions (like abortion) to the states. States have control over driving age, euthanasia, gun control, and marijuana.\nThe supreme court is growing in power, meaning the federal government has more influence\n\nElection regulations remain with states\nThere have been notable landmark legislation from the federal government that has impacted states and been upheld numerous times by the supreme court (affordable care act)\n\nIncreasing hyper partisanship in federal government has resulted in gridlock- meaning states have to do more\nRights are uniformly protected at federal level- such as respect for marriage act 2022. This level of protection supersedes any state-level law.\n\nWhile federal law supersedes state law, in instances like the legalisation of marijuana- state law has gone above federal and gone unchallenged\nCertain national issues demand national response- like Covid-19, the Russia-Ukraine war, or inflation.",

People generally don’t get killed during riots in the UK. and different conceptions of justice. In the UK, murder would get life and serve 15 years. You only serve the time of your longest sentence. In the US, sentences add up.\nAmericans care deeply about liberty. You see this in the UK with people like Jeremy Clarkson and rural farmers. In the UK, the government is paternalistic, in America it’s fuckin annoying.\nJustice- high expectations of what the world is like. Expectations of ‘freedom’ depends on left and right- and they are very angry about it. Americans tend to lack cynicism in comparison to brits. US kids are brought up with the American dream. You can be president! You can be anything! Yippee! (That does not fuckin happen in UK.)\n\nVague history\nPre-1500s- populated by native American tribes. They didn’t have gunpowder or smelted metal. This makes them vulnerable to European travellers.\n1500-1700- many Europeans travel to the new world. The Spanish in particular plundered tribes for gold in the south.\nIn north America the tribes are less wealthy. Settling down was more common.\nVirginia is the first colony established\nSettlers were often religious outcasts and extremists fleeing religious wars in Europe. Many were protestant\n1700-56- Spain, France and Britain speedrun colonising. European settlers move in after and while subjugating the native Americans\nIn areas with few settlers, treaties were drawn up between the natives and the settlers, but they were largely unfair\n56-63- 7 years’ war. Huge global war. Britain won and became the dominant power in north America. However, it has been won by borrowing massive sums of money.\nThe brits decide to tax the Americas because the colonies benefited the most from those debts.\n63-75- 13 colonies that run down the east coast. They are individual, not a single country. They are governed partly by Westminster and most of the inhabitants would have considered themselves British\n1600s- the reformation and the renaissance lead to the enlightenment. John Locke- classical liberal, protestant.\nHe says we have three rights.\nIt is gods will that everybody is alive. If you murder someone, it goes against god’s will.\nGod created humans to be free. Anything that controls you (unfairly, unreasonably or unmorally) is going against gods will.\nEveryone has a right to property. Something in the natural world+ your labour= your property\nSo, then the Americans are getting taxed out of their asshole. They think its shit because they can’t vote for it.\nA group of people dressed up as native Americans storm the Boston harbour. They kick tea into the harbour. It’s called the Boston tea party.\nParliament gets mad and strips Massachusetts of its rights.\nA small number gather and proclaim their independence from the British empire. its not that many people. They sign a document in 1776 called the declaration of independence.\nBritain invades and seizes the coasts. The rebels are forced inland. They rebels are ground down and immortalised. At some point, Britain get bored and stops funding the army- who are eventually defeated. The rebels establish ‘these united states of America’\nThis country now needs federalism because they don’t have a national identity.\nWhat are the nature and principles of the constitution?\n1. Codified constitution- constitution that is written into law\n2. Judiciable constitution- can be enforced by the judiciary\n3. Entrenched constitution- a provision that makes certain amendments either more difficult or impossible to pass\n4. Implied powers- powers a body has that wasn’t explicitly given to them\n5. Supermajority-a majority by greater than one half\n6. Enumerated powers- powers specifically given by the constitution\n4. A ‘necessary and proper clause’- authorizes congress to employ any means that are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end (the permitted end being within the scope of federal power under the constitution)\nLimited government, separation of powers, checks and balances, federalism.\nThe US constitution comes into effect in 1789. It has seven articles, about 4,500 words, with an additional 3,000\n\nArticle 1- deals with congress. Shows they intended congress to be more important than the presidency\nArticle 2- presidency (presidency, not president\nArticle 3- federal courts\nArticle 4- Federalism\nAmendments\n\nMessy notes\n\nThe US Constitution is codified\n- this means that it is judiciable. Only federal courts can rule on this.\n- So, there is two layers of the law- normal and constitutional\n\nIt is designed to be hard to change\n- This is done by requiring supermajorities (66%) to change things. This was done in order to prevent tyranny of the majority\n- Some observers have suggested that this has created a ‘tyranny of the minority’ situation- where well-organised and well-motivated minority groups can undermine democracy. (this is typical of guns- about 2/3s want stricter gun control but this will never fucking happen)\n\nLook up public choice theory\n\na lot of the Constitution is very fucking vague because the founding fathers acknowledged that America is very big, diverse, and will outlive them\n- Enumerated powers- powers with a number- a specific and explicit power given to an institution by the constitution\n- Implied powers- powers that are not explicit, but flow logically (constitution says that the president has power over the army and navy- but it doesn’t mention the air force, because it didn’t exist at the time)\n- There is also the necessary and proper clause- gives congress to do anything it wants to- within reason (they gave money to the unemployed through the CARES act during COVID 19)\n- the constitution predates political parties, but barely. So, everyone was an independent\n- these independents would form factions when a major issue faces the country. (like pro-war and anti-war). Once the issue was resolved, the faction would disband\n- worried that a 51% faction forcing itself upon the 49% faction (supermajorities were introduced for this.)\n- this whole situation is referred to a ‘bipartisanship’. However, this phrase has two meanings:\n\na situation where two political parties exist\na situation where two political parties must work together\n\nAmendments\nFirst amendment- freedom of speech, action and press and religion\n1st — Freedom of speech, action, press and religion\n2nd – keep and bear arms\n3rd no soldiers in homes in peacetime (because food payments)\n4th no unreasonable searches by police- police must have reasonable suspicion\n5th protection and legal process, due process, compensation for property\n6th fair and speedy trial, legal representation, and no hidden shit\n7th jury trial in civil cases against govt action\n8th no cruel and unusual punishment\n9th protects unenumerated rights\n10th powers not in the constitution go to the states\n11th cant sue states in federal court\n12th president and vice elected separately\n13th abolishes slavery (terms and conditions may apply)\n14th citizenship to all persons born in the USA (being a citizen means rights)\n15th everyone can vote (men of colour edition)\n16th govt can get taxes and not give em proportionally\n17th senators are elected\n18th prohibition\n19th everyone can vote (women edition)\n20th different term lengths and smoother transition of power\n21st ending prohibition\n22nd limits the presidency to 2 terms\n23rd residents of Washington DC residents voting\n24th no poll taxes in elections\n25th presidential procedures (JFK rules)\n26th voting at 18 years old\n27th senator pay\nHow is the constitution amended?\n\nTwo-thirds (a supermajority) of both houses of Congress have to vote to introduce an amendment, or two-thirds of states can call a constitutional convention to propose amendments.\nAmendments require the formal support (ratification) of ¾ of states\n\nProposed by a 2/3 vote in congress, ratified by ¾ of the state legislatures\nProposed by a 2/3 vote in congress, ratified by conventions held in ¾ of the states\nProposed at a national convention called by congress when requested by 2/3 of the states, ratified by ¾ of the state legislatures\nProposed by national convention, ratified by conventions.\n\nPros and cons of this system\n\nPros\nCons\n\nProtects smaller states from tyranny of the majority\ncan make for tyranny of the minority\n\nhard to change — so a government can't just take away certain rights\nhard to change when something is outdated\n\nensures fair checks and balances and state's rights\ncan make a weak government (?)\n\nChecks and balances\n\nWhen the constitution was being drafted, three of the founding fathers wrote short newspaper articles (the federalist papers)\nThe goal was to convince votes what the constitution should look like, particularly around controversial issues\nThey are useful for understanding how the founding fathers intended the constitution to be used\n\n(we don’t actually know who wrote which)\n\nIn paper 51, we think Madison/Hamilton is arguing for checks and balances\n\nThis is because each branch of government could have it’s own selfish motivations, which could be shit for the country\n\nSo the other two branches have the power to stop this\n\nSo the phrase ‘checks and balances’ describes how each branch can limit and be limited in their powers\nThis only works when there is a separation of branches\n\nExamples of checks and balances being used\n\nCheck\nInformation\n\nJudicial review\nIn 2020, the Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration's attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program\n\nJudicial review\nIn 2020, in the case Bostock v Clayton County, the Supreme Court ruled that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is unconstitutional under the Civil Rights Act 1964.\n\nVeto power\nBiden vetoed a bill regarding an attempt to row back on the Buy American waiver he introduced for US government-backed charging stations\n\nCalling special sessions\nIn 2021, Biden considered calling a special session of congress to address the looming debt ceiling crisis.\n\nLobbying and negotation\nTrump lobbied for and signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017)\n\nLegislative recommendations\nThe OMB proposes a budget to congress every year.\n\nNominations of justices\nTrump nominated Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barret\n\nEnforcement of court decisions\nTrump's administration enforced the Trump v Hawaii decision (travel ban).

Instead of simply counting all votes across the country as one total: the votes are organised by state.\nEach state is given a certain number of points, known as electoral votes, based on it's population. The larger the state population, the more electoral votes it receives.\nFor example, California has 54, and Wyoming has 3.\nEvery 10 years, a census is conducted, which can result in states gaining or losing electoral votes\nThe way that number of votes a state receives is straightforward:\nthe number of senators a state has, plus the number of members of the House of Representatives it sends to congress\nThe number of senators is always 2.\nFor example, Texas has 2 senators and 32 representatives, so it has 34 electoral college votes.\nTherefore, the minimum number of electoral college votes a state can have is 3.\nIn addition, Washington DC is allocated 3 EC votes under the 23rd amendment (1961.)\nWhen all the EC votes are added together, they total 538:\n435 from the House of Representatives, 100 from senators, and 3 from DC.\nTo win the presidency, a candidate must get a majority of these;\n270 is the majority needed\n\nHow the EC system works\n\npeople in each state vote for which candidate they prefer.\nin most states, the candidate who gets the most votes wins all of the state's EC votes.\nonce all the states have votes, the EC votes are added up to decide the winner.\nWhile this is usually winner-takes-all, Main and Nebraska split their ECVs depending on how many votes each candidate received.\n\n[!NOTE]\nThis system means a candidate becomes president not by winning the most votes from people across the whole country, but by gaining the most EC votes.\n\nThe process\n\nThe popular vote\nCertificates of Ascertainment issued\nSafe Harbour Deadline\nElectors meet and cast votes\nJoint session of congress counts votes\nInauguration day\n\nThe role of Delegates.\nTechnically speaking, the winning candidate does not win the EC votes immediately. Instead, they win a delegate who pledges to vote for them when the EC meets.\n\nin 33 states (plus DC) there is a legal requirement for delegates to vote for who they pledged to vote for\nin 17 states, there is no law about this.\n\nBush v Gore: case study",

In some election years, there are two primaries- one for Democrats and one for Republicans. A voter is allowed to vote in one party's primary only. In other election years, only one party holds a primary. It is unusual for anyone inside the party to challenge a sitting president who plans to run for a second term.\nDifferent states hold their primaries on different dates.\nSome states choose to hold their primaries on the same day as each other to maximize their influence. The most significant example of this is known as 'Super Tuesday', in which lots of states hold their primaries on the same day.\nEach state is given a number of 'delegates' reflecting it's population. Delegates are Party activists. They pledge to go to a meeting (the party convention) that takes place after all states have voted. Delegates vote for a specific candidate reflecting how the voters in their state voted. *By winning in a state, a candidate wins delegates (think of them as points) which are added up as candidates compete in more states. In most cases, there is a proportional rule. If a candidate achieves 20% of the vote in a state, they receive 20% of the delegates from that state.\nAny candidate who gets over 50% of all delegates wins- they become the official presidential candidate for that party. This is confirmed at the party convention at the end of the voting process. All delegates meet and cast their votes to make the role official.\n\nWhat are the different kinds of primaries?\nOpen primary\n\na primary that does not require voters to be affiliated with a political party to vote.\nIowa, Hawaii, Wyoming, Idaho\nClosed primary\na primary that requires voters to be registered with a political party to vote in it\nAlaska for Democrats, Nevada, Michigan, Missouri for Republicans\nSemi-closed primary\nvoters can choose to participate in either the democratic OR the republican primary\nNew Hampshire, North Carolina\nCaucus\ndeciding the candidates for primaries with discussion in a meeting.\nHawaii- open, Colorado- closed, Maine- Semi-closed\nThese can be open, closed, and semi-closed individually\n\nHomework questions\nWhat are the three methods through which delegates can be allocated through primaries and caucuses?\n- Pledged: pledged delegates are democratic delegates who are required to vote for a specific candidate- the one who won the most votes in the primary, or a caucus. There are three types- district delegates, at-large delegates, and add-on delegates (who represent elected officials or party leaders)\n- Unpledged: AKA superdelegates. Unique to the Democrats, again.\n- Bound: Republican delegates who are just pledged delegates but republican\n- Unbound: just superdelegates\n\nProportional- For Democrats (they only use this one) they have a formula for allocating delegates based on the statewide vote in primaries and caucuses. Candidates must receive at least 15% of the vote to get any delegates. Republicans do this too on occasion\nWinner-take-all: all of a state's delegates available in a contest are allocated to the candidate who receives the majority vote in a state primary or caucus\nHybrid- there are many versions, but most common is majority-take-all, where delegates are won proportionally based on the statewide vote. Still, a candidate may win them all if they receive over 50 percent of the vote.\n\nWhich states have the earliest primaries and caucuses and why?\n\nIowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina all have primaries/caucuses in February.\nIowa starts early because it takes a while to do (caucus)\nNew Hampshire starts early because it legally has shotgun (primary)\n\nWhat is frontloading, and why does it happen?\n\nFrontloading involves individual states moving their primary or caucus day to the front of the presidential primary season calendar\nit happens because snowballing happens.\n\nBiden did it in 2024 to try and help himself gain momentum.\n\nOR to make sure your state has more of a say if a candidate has already become presumptive, or the candidate they wanted to vote for ran out of money/confidence/etc and dropped out\n\nWhat is Super Tuesday, and what was Super Duper Tuesday?\n\nSuper Tuesday is the day when the largest number of states hold their primary elections or caucuses simultaneously. Because of the large number of states participating, Super Tuesday has a substantial impact on the allocation of delegates.\nSuper Duper Tuesday was for the 2008 primaries/caucuses- ~20 states participated.\n\nWhen did Trump secure a majority of delegates in 2020, and how many states had not voted by that point?\n\nhe became the presumptive Republican candidate on March 17th, 2020.\n(the republican convention encouraged other states to use winner-takes-all)\naround 25 states had not voted by the time Trump became presumptive candidate\n\nStrengths and weaknesses\nOpen Primaries\n+&gt; maximizes the choice of voters. anyone can vote in either party's primary. This can be very important in years where only one party has a primary because it allows voters to participate without being registered\n+&gt; they can attract more moderate voters.\n-&gt; subject to spoiling tactics- Republicans slowing down a democrat candidate, wasting time and resources\n-&gt; why are you letting rando's vote.\nClosed Primaries\n+&gt; prevents spoiling tactics\n+&gt; protects the identity (vibe) of a party\n-&gt; prevents independents from voting, which could damage electoral chances.\n-&gt; unfair in years where only one party holds a primary",

(some members get scrutiny, but it's significantly less than cabinet)\n\nEXOP aren't talked about at all in the constitution. They are used much more than the cabinet because it's better to give a job to an agency which gets less scrutiny- so cabinet becomes useless.\nSusie Wiles: White house chief of staff. Could be called the second most powerful person in the US.\n\nthe problem is that EXOP can conflict with cabinet because they are doing the same job- so they do the same job twice (which is not good)\nInitially, FDR sets up EXOP to help deal with the great depression, because he was building all this shit and needs to get it right. It is initially quite small. Now it has ~1,800 employees\nthe budget is voted for by congress.\n\nFranklin Delanore Roosevelt\nFranklin D.

		"content": "#lessonminor #unfinished\nPolitics in the USA\n1790s-1830s\n•The dominant view at this time was that whites were a Herrenvolk – ‘Master folk/race’. This particularly applied to the Anglo-Saxon races of the Germans and English.\n•God had created the United States by allowing them to win the War of Independence.\n•The white race therefore had the God given right to settle across the continent. This theory was known as ‘Manifest Destiny’.\n•The USA was a white country. Non-whites could not be citizens of the Republic. Therefore, they didn’t possess any benefits of being a citizen – namely rights.\n•All white men deserved equal rights to one another.\n•Native Americans were racially inferior. They could be put onto ‘reservations’, but violent resistance had to be crushed.\n•Blacks were inferior to whites. And women were emotional and reliant upon men. They certainly did not have the ability to make political decisions.\n1830s-1865\n•A huge divide opens in the US. It is driven partly by the Industrial Revolution, with the North industrialising and the South relying on exporting cotton (which was worth more than its weight in gold!). The South’s tropical climate allowed this to happen. (Remember Clinton’s criticism of Madison and pressure groups!)\n•The North wants to ban slavery, as its being seen as immoral by lots of countries. The British Empire had already begun to ban it from around 1800. Southerners disagree.\n•The situation is complicated by the fact that the US is still expanding. Should new states be ‘slave-states’ or ‘free-states’? The issue of slavery is a state rights issue, not a federal issue.\n•In the 1850s, the Democratic Party splits over the issue, and a new party forms that is exclusively anti-slavery, called the Republican Party.\nWhite supremacism is still completely normal at this point. People just disagree over whether non-whites deserve to be made citizens of the Republic\n•In November 1860, the Republican candidate – Abraham Lincoln – becomes US President but only carries Northern states.\n•Southern states secede from the US en masse. They form a new country called the Confederate States of America (CSA).\n•The USA invades the CSA. The better USA economy allows it to defeat the CSA in 1865.\n•Abraham Lincoln then forces the adoption of the 13th Amendment, banning slavery. It’s know as the ‘Emancipation Amendment’.\n•The 15th Amendment made it illegal to stop someone voting because of their race (provided that they were a man…)\n1865-1940s\n•Black People are emancipated in the South and given equal rights. However…\n•Southern states hate the Northerns and consider them invaders. The Southern states do everything possible to frustrate the new equal rights laws. A terrorist group called the Klu Klux Klan is set up.\n•Segregation is enforced through ‘Jim Crow laws’ (rhymes with something). Legally, Black People should enjoy equality quality public services (eg. schools) to whites, but in practice this does not happen.\n•Laws are carefully designed to prevent blacks from voting, such as needing to pass a literacy tests before you can vote.\n•The final Native Americans were forced onto reservations by the US Army in the ‘Indian Wars’.\n•A female suffrage movement developed after the Civil War and the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote in 1920\n1940s-1960s\n•Opposition to segregation in the South develops through the  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr.\n•They win several legal victories, arguing that segregation is racist. They get greater Civil Rights.\n•However, there is extreme violence in the South and some other cities. Racism remains deeply culturally imbedded. The terrorist Klu Klux Klan re-emerges.\n•President Johnson (Dem) supports the Civil Rights Act in 1964. Democratic support plummets in the Southern states and it switches to the Republicans. The South had been known as the ‘Solid South’ for Democrats.\n1960s-2000s\nBussing orders school districts to bus white children to schools in majority black areas. It began in the 1960s, but faded away in the 1980 s due to opposition from whites in the South.\n•An argument develops that says that changing rights only gives equality of opportunity. What was really needed was equality of ‘results’ (meaning ‘equality of outcome’).\n•A movement calling for affirmative action forms. Affirmative action means positive discrimination – where members of minority groups are given advantages over majority groups (eg. Easier access to university). The goal it to make minority groups wealthier.\n•Furthermore, integration (opposed to segregation) is imposed on Southern states by the federal government.\n•A feminist movement also develops in the 1960s – although the Equal Rights Amendment fails to adopted, despite being passed in Congress and being signed by President Carter.\n•An LGBT rights amendment develops. Harvey Milk becomes the first openly gay official in California, but is murdered in 1978. Homosexual acts between men are legalised by the Supreme Court in southern states in 2003.\n2000s-\n•Affirmative action has been increasingly criticised. Several Supreme Court rulings have found against affirmative action projects since 2003.\n•LGBT rights have improved – The US military policy of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t tell’ was removed in 2011, and same-sex marriage legalised in 2015 by a Supreme Court ruling.\n•The # MeToo movement against sexual assault has developed since 2017.\n•President Obama worked to allow easier access for refugees to the USA.\n•The white supremacy movement has begun to grow since 2016. Violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters broke out in Charlottesville in 2017. Hostility to immigration and Islamophobia has also grown.\nWhat is immigration like today?\nKey things to remember (cultural differences)\n•The USA is ‘a nation of immigrants’. Many Americans’ identity comes from having dual heritage (eg. Italian-American; Irish-American). This is partly due to a belief in the American Dream – any hardworking, morally good person can become wealthy – that attracted immigrants\n•The USA has become increasingly intolerant to Hispanic people and Muslims, due partly to the War on Drugs (starting in the 1970s), the War on Terror (2001) and a big dollop of bigotry – possibly due the insular nature of rural American communities and existing racial politics.\n•De-industrialisation since the 1980s has created the Rust Belt. Immigrants can be perceived as threats to the security of semi and unskilled labourers. (Feeling keen? Look up the Modernisation Loser Thesis!)\nTotals:\n- as of 2023, 27% of the US population are either immigrants or the children of immigrants. That's about 90 million people\n- around 3/4 of those are in the US legally. Hence, it is estimated that there are around 22 million illegal immigrants or children of illegal immigrants.\n\nThe US has the largest immigrant population of any country in the world\nThe figures in 2024:\n\naround 1 million people legally migrated to the USA\nit is estimated that about 3 million illegally migrated.\nNote that the term undocumented and illegal are different but have a big overlap. Undocumented is mostly children of illegal immigrants.\n\nWhy is illegal immigration so high?\n\nin the 1940s, the US allowed large numbers of guest workers from Mexico. They could stay to work briefly- often coming as seasonable labour. However, this was ended in 1964. Thus, many people chose to make a one-way trip\n\npart of the problem is that the people would come and go seasonally- so many chose to go and not leave.\n\nThere was exceptional instability in Latin America in recent years- notably in Mexico and Venezuela\nA law called Title 42 was used to expel new arrivals during COVID to protect the population from disease. Some people were expelled several times- but that was counted as individual people, inflating the statistics.\n\nWhat has illegal immigration been like since the 1970s\n\nborder encounters by the Border Guard are used as a broad estimation to gauge the number of illegal migrants\nnumbers wa\nThere was a gradual increase form 1970-2000, a reduction\n\nHow have US presidents responded?\n\nin the eighties and nineties, both Reagan and Clinton deployed more border agents and introduced harsher penalties for illegal migration. However, this encouraged even less seasonal migration\nIn 1986, the Immigration reform and control act is introduced.\nMakes it illegal to hire undocumented migrants\nbut grants amnesty to 3 million migrants, and also does an executive order to give that to children of undocumented migrants' children\nFrom 2000-2016\nthe Mexican\nbirth rate dropped, leading to fewer youths trying to cross\nGeorge Bush:\n\nDeployed more border guards, citing 9/11\nintroduced 'secure communities' in 2008, meaning that anyone arrested automatically had their migration status checked\n\nBarack Obama\n\nmakes it easier to get visas for seasonal work\ntried to introduce the DREAM act, making it so kids who came in illegally can work (although they can't be here forever)\n\nthis is EXACTLY what George Bush tried to introduce. It failed due to a republican filibuster\n\nin 2012, he puts out a memorandum (DACA) instructed the federal police to not apprehend undocumented immigrants who arrived as minors\n\nin 2014, he expands this to DAPA, which applies it to parents too\n\nThis gets blocked by the supreme court in 2016\n\nHe maximises 'temporary protected status' which means that some migrants (from countries/minorities) and gives a lot of them out\n\nHe had a record number of deportations. He deports more than Trump in his first term.\n\nTrump (first term):\n\nhe says he is going to build a wall\n\nhe only succeeds in building a fifth of it\nhe says he'll make Mexico pay by putting tariffs. he is stupid\n\nHe tries to phase out DACA but this is blocked by district courts\nin the summer of 2017, Trump orders the Family-separation policy. Children of undocumented migrants are taken from their parents and put in care homes and the parents are deported/put in jail\n\nEssay planning\n•How many Americans have been affected?\n•Does one point cause/directly-affect other points?\n•If each point was individually ‘rubbed out’ of history, which one would change the USA the most?",

		"content": "John Locke\nHistorical context of John Locke\n\nSummer 1683, Charles II has been king for more than 20 years. Locke doesn't like Charlie boy — he is also somewhat linked to a plot to kill the king. He moves to the Netherlands to avoid capture.\nLocke was very important to British politics. He was an apprentice to the Earl of Shaftsbury, who was basically a radical Marxist.\n\nhe believed that Parliament should meet a bit more often\nhe thinks the king should have a bit less power\n\nThere is only one thing that Locke hates more than the King: Catholics. Locke worries about the growing influence of Catholicism in England — when James comes in, he is a lot harsher on protestants. Locke is annoyed by this. He decides to come up with a system where people of different religions don't try to kill each other.\nLocke tries to do a lot of philosophy.\nThen in 1689, James gets overthrown and the new rulers are more tolerant.\nHe comes back to England to write 3 books; two of which he didn't put his name on, because they were so radical.\n\nHe theorised that monarchs punishing people for different beliefs is ineffective at changing their beliefs, so people should be allowed to believe what they want to believe and people tolerate that.\n\nAlso, whenever certain beliefs are banned, violence happens.\n\nLocke is literally just the original 'power of friendship' guy.\nHe writes another book on the Monarch.\n\nHe said that the Divine Right of Kings (King has to do whatever they want or God will be angry at you) is... bad.\nHe says that people should be able to choose their leaders. He says that if the ruler breaks the people's trust, the people should be able to overthrow them. This is literally the foundation of democracy.\n\nAlthough, keep in mind he still hated Catholics (because they were sworn to one ruler — the Pope), and didn't count Atheists. He also invested some money in the slave trade.\nThese ideas are the foundation of Liberalism.\n\nrights\ntolerance\nfreedom\ndemocracy\nequality of opportunity\nlimited government\nrule of law\n\nCore ideas of Liberalism\n\nIndividualism\n\nThe idea that individuals are capable of making decisions for themselves, as opposed to requiring their 'betters' to do that on their behalf.\nIndividuals are self-interested, rather than being concerned about wider society. However, as individuals do not exist in a vacuum, liberalism argues for tolerance of others, particularly of their political and religious views. If someone is not causing you harm, they should be allowed to continue their business.\n\nIt's just 'treat others how you wish to be treated.'\n\nThe change in understanding of tolerance\nThe understanding of tolerance has evolved. Mary Wollstonecraft argued to extend tolerance to women, particularly in the case of the right to vote. In the 20th century, Betty Friedan continued this, arguing for full equality for women.\n\nOver time, different groups have been the focus of debates around tolerance.\n\nIn the UK, this has included allowing Catholics and Jews to sit in Parliament, tolerance towards migrants, homosexuality, and now transgender people.\n\nLiberal denominations\nWhilst all liberals support the argument that the individual is more important than any collective group, modern and classical liberals have different ideas on what liberals can achieve in isolation.\n\nClassical liberals support 'egoistic individualism'\n\nthat is the belief that humans are rational, and therefore self-interested, therefore self-reliant and capable of thriving on their own.\nsociety is atomistic — we are all of the atoms: separate.\n\nModern liberals are critical of this concept, supporting 'developmental individualism', noting that personal circumstances play a big role in an individual's ability to thrive in isolation. These situations mostly refer to inequalities — such as in race, class, and gender.\n\nWhilst liberals argue in favour of a tolerant, fair society, they cannot control other's social attitudes.\n\nConsequently, modern liberals (such as John Rawls) argue that if humans are left to their own devices, inequalities will get worse. Therefore, the role of the state is to help individuals develop and thrive through opportunities.\n\nFreedom/liberty\n\nFor liberals, freedom is not granted by a ruler or government, it is a natural right that humans have by virtue of being human. The state's role is to uphold this freedom by preventing harm to individuals that would impact their liberty, and to enforce contracts that individuals freely enter into with each other.\n\nLocke described this role as vital for ensuring people were free.\n\n'where there is no law, there is no liberty'\nthis concept antithetical to the idea of Negative freedom\n\n&quot;Negative liberty is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints.&quot; (i.e. the govt. should leave you alone.)\n\nThe state only exists by consent of the governed, which is also known as the social contract — which Locke believes that humans enter into willingly to help ensure that there is an arbitrator to uphold the freedom of individuals.\nLocke says that when a government ceases to promote freedom, the people have the right to withdraw their consent to be governed and replace the government.\nState\n\nThe more you are left alone, the freer you are.\n\nBut without a state, bad things will happen.\nBut if the state is too big, bad things will happen.\n\nThe state needs to exist in order to enforce the laws so that people can be free, but also as small as possible so the state can't infringe on anybody's rights.\n\nthe state is a 'necessary evil'\n\nThis is called a 'Nightwatchman State' (Locke invented this)\n\nSo, the state's job is:\n\nprotect us from each other\nprotect us from foreign countries\nenforce contracts\n\nThe government exists by the consent of the people via a 'social contract.' People would be more willing to obey a government whose authority is limited, is elected by the people, and which is restricted in it's ability to restrict rights via a constitution.\nModern liberalism and the state\nSome liberals have adopted a more positive view of the state — because of the potential good a state can do to allow human flourishing: aka an 'enabling state'.\n\n[!EXAMPLE] Case study\nAround the start of the 20th century, it was clear that many in industrial Britain were caught in a 'poverty trap' — forced to work for low pay that could barely cover rent, without any means to retire or miss work because of illness. Children were also caught in this, and so they were unable to be educated and therefore broaden their prospects.\nAs such, modern liberals questioned whether there was genuine equality of opportunity, and whether it was fair to assume those in poverty earned it through idleness.\n\nso, modern liberals called for the state to ensure genuine freedom of opportunity, and a safety net (pensions/national insurance for unemployment/welfare/benefits) for those struggling\n\nthese ideas are connected to Keynesian economic theory and John Stuart Mill\n\nRationalism\n\n[!INFO]\nEveryone is a rational person, so they are capable of making the best decisions for themselves.\n\nThis is rationalism, which - for classical liberals - is the foundation of personal freedom and means that the government should intervene as minimally as possible\n\nThinkers here are John Locke and <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/politics/03-ideologies/liberalism/liberalism/#adam-smith\">Adam Smith</a>\n\nthey argue that individuals, guided by reason, can identify their own interests and act in ways that promote societal progress\nSo therefore, we have some rights that should never be infringed\n\nthe right to life is the most important one\n\nthey are split on right to an abortion / right to death\nSome also argued that this idea advocates for laissez-faire capitalism, the main proponent being\n\nAdam Smith\nAdam Smith had this idea called the invisible hand of the market:\n\nBecause people are rational, this means that their actions collectively create wealth and efficiency\n\ni.e. the market works because everyone is acting well within the market.\n\nThis is the classical liberal idea about the economy, which is completely different from <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/politics/03-ideologies/liberalism/liberalism/#modern-liberalism\">Modern liberal's ideas about the state.</a>\n\nEquality/social justice\nLiberal Democracy",

Think of it like pure squash and water with a drop of squash.\n\nIn the 1800s, there are a shitton of revolutions. This is considered the origin of socialism.\nIn 1848, Marx publishes the communist manifesto whilst with his friend, Friedrich Engels.\nDemocratic Socialism is Marxism without the violence. (This is the one that you can't talk about in the exam)\n\nBeatrice &amp; Sidney Webb (they found the Fabian society which is still very involved with the labour party)\n\nthese are two of our key thinkers\n\nSocial Democracy is a compromise between socialism and capitalism.\nThe third way is Tony fucking Blair.\nMarxism\nImportant distinction\nWe learn about Marx's ideas, not how they were carried out.\nThe exam board does not consider soviet communism to be communism.\n\nMarx\nSoviet Communism\n\nPopular today in universities and some very radical trade unions\nseen in the eastern bloc\n\ncriticised for corrupting Marxist ideas\n\nMarx's view of history\nPre-revolution phase\nAlways involves two classes- two economic groups. Today, it's the capitalists and the workers. Marx says that there is a constant cycle of creating new economic systems which still uphold oppression. Marx says that capitalism will be the last of these before communism.\nHe uses an idea of Hegel- dialectical change- he says that the way that ideas develop is by a thesis and an antithesis challenging each other, which then creates a synthesis.\nMarx got taught by Hegel. He steals the idea and calls it dialectical/historical materialism- the same idea but the theses and antitheses are economic systems.\nthis is why Marxists are atheists- because they are materialists.\nIt's materialism (empiricism) and rationalism (idealism- like belief in God or the soul)\n\nMarx says that every society is underpinned by oppression.\n&quot;The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.&quot;\nFor Capitalism, there are two classes; the Bourgeoisie and the Proletariat.\nThe Bourgeoisie are those who own Capital (the means of production) or Land (the resources of production)\nNature of society\nMarx talks about the nature of society- that being the substructure (the economic system) and the superstructure (which is both a product the substructure and what helps keep it in place)\nThe superstructure includes education, police, religion, nationalism, media, and the legal system.\nthe legal system enforces private ownership\nreligion can enforce that things are individually your fault/god's will\nthe police enforce the legal system\nnationalism means that people don't think that their problems are caused by the upper class, but by people of other countries\nHe calls this false consciousness\n\nNature of capitalism\nMarx believes that capitalism will inevitably collapse.\n\nthere is a fixed amount of wealth in the world.\n\nthe rich can only get richer if the poor get poorer/ same thing with power\n(technically this is untrue)\n\nto earn more profits, capitalists cut wages. this happens across the economy\nbut workers need money to buy the capitalist's goods- so some capitalist companies go bankrupt when wages are too low.\nthen the bankrupt capitalist joins the working class\nthe capitalists then become a smaller and smaller class.\n\nMarx's theory of alienation\nAlso, workers become alienated from their humanity, because they never create product from start to finish (which is vital to humanity). This is because capitalism encourages specialisation. Workers become depressed- this is akin to being a prisoner.\nRevolutionary phase\nThe oppressed class will eventually realise that they are being oppressed as a group, and they will gain class conciousness.\n\n[!tip] Context for Marx's time\nWhen Marx is writing in the 1840 s, the majority of people don't have a right to vote.\n\nThe phases of the revolution\n\nThe workers spontaneously rise up against the capitalists\nNote that Marxists do hate Social Democrats, because they are compliant in the system, but they pretend to be on the side of Socialism.\nWorkers seize control of the factories and establish democratic workers' councils.\nThe state is seized. The state becomes a dictatorship of the proletariat — a workers' democracy where capitalists are prevented from having political power.\nA 'dictatorship' of the proletariat is not a traditional dictatorship, it's a dictatorship because the capitalists are locked out.\nBecause everything is collectively owned, there is no bourgeoisie class. Therefore, there is only one class, and there is a classless society.\n\nThe state performs two functions:\n\nTo 'protect the gains of the revolution' — to fight against internal enemies (bourgeoisie) who could lead a counterrevolution.\nTo prevent external threats: invasion of nearby capitalist countries — which could also be fascists.\n- Anarchists think that the state should be gone cold turkey\nTo create a 'planned economy', where every industry is nationalized, and decisions about the economy are made centrally.\n\nCommunists utopia\nMarx believed that this was inevitable, 95% of what he writes is about the pre-revolutionary phase.\n\nThe post-revolutionary phase happens once the whole world has become communist\nEveryone will live in communes of about 200 people (hence the term communism)\nThere will be de-urbanization\nbecause cities are a product of capitalism\nThere is no need for a state.\nThe state will 'wither away' according to Marx\nHuman nature will completely change.\nUnder capitalism, humans are selfish, competitive and materialistic, because those traits are encouraged by the superstructure.\nWith a new superstructure, human nature will change and become flawless.\n\n[!summary] —\n&quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;\n\nDemocratic socialism\n\nHistorical context\nWas capitalism changing?\n\nMarx predicted that over time, wealth would concentrate into the hands of a smaller and smaller bourgeoisie.\n\nHowever, this guy called Eduard Bernstein argued that this wasn't happening\n\nBy the 1980s, Bernstein argued that capitalism was spreading wealth, not concentrating it.\nThis was because of\n\n**— the one that you can't talk about in essays.

Think of it like pure squash and water with a drop of squash.\n\nIn the 1800s, there are a shitton of revolutions. This is considered the origin of socialism.\nIn 1848, Marx publishes the communist manifesto whilst with his friend, Friedrich Engels.\nDemocratic Socialism is Marxism without the violence. (This is the one that you can't talk about in the exam)\n\nBeatrice &amp; Sidney Webb (they found the Fabian society which is still very involved with the labour party)\n\nthese are two of our key thinkers\n\nSocial Democracy is a compromise between socialism and capitalism.\nThe third way is Tony fucking Blair.\nMarxism\nImportant distinction\nWe learn about Marx's ideas, not how they were carried out.\nThe exam board does not consider soviet communism to be communism.\n\nMarx\nSoviet Communism\n\nPopular today in universities and some very radical trade unions\nseen in the eastern bloc\n\ncriticised for corrupting Marxist ideas\n\nMarx's view of history\nPre-revolution phase\nAlways involves two classes- two economic groups. Today, it's the capitalists and the workers. Marx says that there is a constant cycle of creating new economic systems which still uphold oppression. Marx says that capitalism will be the last of these before communism.\nHe uses an idea of Hegel- dialectical change- he says that the way that ideas develop is by a thesis and an antithesis challenging each other, which then creates a synthesis.\nMarx got taught by Hegel. He steals the idea and calls it dialectical/historical materialism- the same idea but the theses and antitheses are economic systems.\nthis is why Marxists are atheists- because they are materialists.\nIt's materialism (empiricism) and rationalism (idealism- like belief in God or the soul)\n\nMarx says that every society is underpinned by oppression.\n&quot;The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.&quot;\nFor Capitalism, there are two classes; the Bourgeoisie and the Proletariat.\nThe Bourgeoisie are those who own Capital (the means of production) or Land (the resources of production)\nNature of society\nMarx talks about the nature of society- that being the substructure (the economic system) and the superstructure (which is both a product the substructure and what helps keep it in place)\nThe superstructure includes education, police, religion, nationalism, media, and the legal system.\nthe legal system enforces private ownership\nreligion can enforce that things are individually your fault/god's will\nthe police enforce the legal system\nnationalism means that people don't think that their problems are caused by the upper class, but by people of other countries\nHe calls this false consciousness\n\nNature of capitalism\nMarx believes that capitalism will inevitably collapse.\n\nthere is a fixed amount of wealth in the world.\n\nthe rich can only get richer if the poor get poorer/ same thing with power\n(technically this is untrue)\n\nto earn more profits, capitalists cut wages. this happens across the economy\nbut workers need money to buy the capitalist's goods- so some capitalist companies go bankrupt when wages are too low.\nthen the bankrupt capitalist joins the working class\nthe capitalists then become a smaller and smaller class.\n\nMarx's theory of alienation\nAlso, workers become alienated from their humanity, because they never create product from start to finish (which is vital to humanity). This is because capitalism encourages specialisation. Workers become depressed- this is akin to being a prisoner.\nRevolutionary phase\nThe oppressed class will eventually realise that they are being oppressed as a group, and they will gain class conciousness.\n\n[!tip] Context for Marx's time\nWhen Marx is writing in the 1840 s, the majority of people don't have a right to vote.\n\nThe phases of the revolution\n\nThe workers spontaneously rise up against the capitalists\nNote that Marxists do hate Social Democrats, because they are compliant in the system, but they pretend to be on the side of Socialism.\nWorkers seize control of the factories and establish democratic workers' councils.\nThe state is seized. The state becomes a dictatorship of the proletariat — a workers' democracy where capitalists are prevented from having political power.\nA 'dictatorship' of the proletariat is not a traditional dictatorship, it's a dictatorship because the capitalists are locked out.\nBecause everything is collectively owned, there is no bourgeoisie class. Therefore, there is only one class, and there is a classless society.\n\nThe state performs two functions:\n\nTo 'protect the gains of the revolution' — to fight against internal enemies (bourgeoisie) who could lead a counterrevolution.\nTo prevent external threats: invasion of nearby capitalist countries — which could also be fascists.\n- Anarchists think that the state should be gone cold turkey\nTo create a 'planned economy', where every industry is nationalized, and decisions about the economy are made centrally.\n\nCommunists utopia\nMarx believed that this was inevitable, 95% of what he writes is about the pre-revolutionary phase.\n\nThe post-revolutionary phase happens once the whole world has become communist\nEveryone will live in communes of about 200 people (hence the term communism)\nThere will be de-urbanization\nbecause cities are a product of capitalism\nThere is no need for a state.\nThe state will 'wither away' according to Marx\nHuman nature will completely change.\nUnder capitalism, humans are selfish, competitive and materialistic, because those traits are encouraged by the superstructure.\nWith a new superstructure, human nature will change and become flawless.\n\n[!summary] —\n&quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;",

He thinks the 10 commandments don’t matter, only love does.Agape is a selfless love\nPolyamory – to not be adulterous. As long as the partner is still loved, adultery doesn’t matter (?) On the other hand, forms of polyamory could be selfish, prioritising the self by having multiple partners rather than being devoted to one personSex work, is this selfless? Definitely selfish on both sides, exploitative and not actually love. Lust instead.Homosexuality and Christianity – Fletcher may think that it doesn’t matter whether someone is homosexual or not, as long as it is true and pure love. This may contradict Christian ideas – especially Catholic\n\nThe four working principles\n1.       Pragmatism: it is based on experience rather than on theory2.       Relativism: it is based on making the absolute laws of Christian ethics relative3.       Positivism: it begins with belief in the reality and importance of love4.       Personalism: persons, not laws or anything else, are at the centre of situation ethics\nPolyamory: evaluated by whether multiple relationships genuinely foster love, honesty and care rather than harm. Not “always wrong” - depends on honesty, consent etc. If relationships are grounded in agape (selfless love), they can be morally valid. The dignity and happiness of individuals matter more than traditional monogamy rules.Sex work:Judged by whether it protects workers’ dignity and safety. Context matters – exploitation is wrong but consensual safe sex work can be morally acceptable. If motivated by care (e.g. providing for a family) it can align with love. Protecting workers’ rights and safety is most important.\n\nThe six fundamental principles\n1.       Love is the only intrinsically good thing2.       Love is the ruling norm in ethics3.       Love is justice distributed4.       Love wills the neighbours good regardless of if you like your neighbour5.       Only the end justifies the means6.       Love decides on each situation as it occurs — without a set of laws to guide it\nThis follows for all sub-topics that could be asked in sexual ethics:Because there are no laws and morals are decided upon from situation to situation, as long as the decision abides by the first 5 principles, it is always ethical.Whether something is ‘loving’ is that which you have to define for yourself. Is pain loving? Is the end loving — can ends be loving in a capitalist system which demands money? Is it entirely focussed on ‘loving’ over any other moral laws_? What even is love in any given situation_? All of which are subjective.\nCould talk about the Lavender Brown hair thing: she did it for money, as is the case with 99% of sex work. Is that loving?Could talk about pornography. People sharing it for joy with each other — means (sexual trafficking, immoral acts) could be argued to not matter? Or perhaps is the end if we define the end as widespread immoral sexual acts — then not ethical?\n\nConscious\n-Fletcher: conscious a verb not a noun; a term that describes attempts to make decisions creatively-&gt; helps us figure things out-process of figuring out what the loving thing to do in a situation is-it is not a ‘thing’; not a set moral compass\nPolyamory- is it truly the loving solution in a given situation?-Some engage in polyamory to satisfy another partner’s desire for multiple relationships, not necessarily maintaining their own happiness-&gt; this is more harmful than loving--&gt; jealousy and insecurity are often introduced in poly relationships\nTalk about the tragedy of Jerry (Love Without Limits)- feels neglected, insecure (compared to Joe sexually)-&gt; unfair treatment towards Jerry from Heidi\n\nUtilitarianism\n\nSpecification\nHow it can be applied\nScholars\nCriticisms\n\nAct utilitarianism\n-polyamory:  - sex work: - BDSM: - homosexuality:\n- Bentham  - Peter Singer\n-issues with calculation and measuring pleasure -issues with liberty/ rights + justifying immoral actions\n\nwhat it is (calculating the consequences of each situation on its own merits) and its use in promoting the greatest amount of good over evil, or pleasure over pain\n-judge an action based on whether it produces the most amount of pleasure compared to other actions -\n\nHedonic calculus\nCan be used by asking: - Does this act maximise pleasure and minimise pain?  - Is it consensual, safe for the involved  - Is the more pleasure than pain and is it short-term or long-term\nBentham J S Mill\n\nwhat it is (calculating the benefit or harm of an  act through its consequences) and its use as a  measure of individual pleasure\n\nRule utilitarianism\n-polyamory:  - if polyamory is transparent and consensual, may increase happiness for those involved - if rules of honesty are broken, instability and harm to children/ families may result - rule utilitarianism would endorse polyamory only under a general rule on consensual transparency, since deception reduces overall utility - sex work: - “sexual activity should not exploit or harm” - positive utility: legalised, regulated sex work can reduce harm (STI’s, trafficking) - if unregulated, risks exploitation + long-term unhappiness - BDSM: -  - homosexuality:\nJ.S Mill - Mill’s conception of society us of individuals each pursuing what seems good to them, their only universal bond being the wrongness or illegality of harming others\n\nwhat it is (following accepted laws that lead to  the greatest overall balance of good over evil,  or pleasure over pain) and its use in promoting  the common good\nto make things illegal because they go against religious morality must be rejected bc it has been the foundation of religious persecution -as long as there is consent amongst all those involved -harm principle: people should be free to do as they like as long as they don’t harm others (this includes consensual sexual behaviours which are private)\n\nUtility\nJudge sexual acts by their consequences (happiness and suffering)\n\nThe use of the significant concept of utility (seeking the greatest balance of good over evil, or pleasure over pain) in teleological and relativist approaches to ethics\n\nNatural moral law\n\nSpecification Points\nKey Knowledge\nHow it can be applied to the case studies\n\nTelos\nOrigins of the significant concept of telos (the ultimate purpose) in Aristotle and its religious development in the writing of Aquinas\nPolyamory: Relationships should cultivate flourishing so it can be seen as problematic if its undermining trust but if its mutual among all partners then it's okay. You could also reject it because it undermines the purpose of a marriage leading to procreation and spiritual unity. Sex work: Sex work doesn’t build virtue as having relations becomes more of a business transaction. It also is against the telos of sexuality which is procreation, but it may also be a positive way to prevent worse things. Pornography: It encourages lust which limits human flourishing and does not reach the telos of virtue. Removes sexual pleasure from its telos BDSM: If it isn’t cruel and cultivates virtue then it’s telos is okay. But it can also distort the natural telos of sex Homosexuality and Christianity: wouldnt be judged whether it fosters flourishing or friendship\n\nThe Four Tiers of Law\nEternal Law: the principles by which God made and controls the universe and which are only fully known to God Divine Law: the law of God revealed in the Bible, particularly in the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount Natural Law: the moral law of God within human nature that is discoverable using reason  Human Law: the laws of nations\nPolyamory: EL/DL – Marriage is one man, and woman, as polyamory contradicts divine order NL – Undermines stable family unit à against primary precept of living in society Sex work: EL/DL – Condemns lust and exploitation NL – Reduces sex to pleasure/profit à against primary precepts of reproduction and unity HL – often illegal or heavily regulated, seen as harmful to social order Pornography: EL/DL – Condemns lust, objectification NL – Sex detached from procreation à misuse of sexuality HL – Legal in many places, but regulated; tensions with moral law BDSM: EL/DL – Seen as misuse of body, contrary to chastity NL – if consensual, may not directly perpetuate the primary precept of reproduction, but risks harm à against preservation of life HL – permitted if consensual, but restrivted if harmful Homosexuality and Christianity: EL/DL – Traditional Christian teaching condemns homosexual acts; some modern interpretations emphasise love and fidelity  NL – same-sex acts frustrate reproduction à considered wrong HL – legalised same-sex marriage in many societies; diverges from traditional NML stance\n\nThe Precepts\nThe 5 primary precepts are: preservation of life, ordering of society, worship of God, education of children, reproduction. Other knowledge: - what they are and how they are related   - the key precept (do good, avoid evil)   - secondary precept\nPolyamory: 789 Sex work:  Pornography: BDSM: Doesn’t contribute to an ordered society as its violent, could promote violence to others  Homosexuality and Christianity: Doesn’t produce children or preserve life as homosexuality doesn’t often lead to children\n\nKantian ethics\n\nKey terms\nSexual ethics case studies applied to Kantian ethics\n\nDuty - acting morally to reach good without worrying about the consequences (deontological).\nPolyamory - you have a duty to your partner  Polyamory disrupts this\n\nHypothetical imperative - a command to act to achieve a desired result. ‘If’ ... ‘Then’.\nSex work - you are using someone. If they do this then I will feel this. Sex work is not allowed.\n\nCategorical imperative - a command to act that is good regardless of consequences. à formula of the law of nature à formula of the end in itself à formula of the kingdom of ends\nHomosexuality and Christianity - Kant would argue that homosexuality doesn’t seem universalisible, since if everyone were homosexual then the species could not continue and then no one would exist to follow the duty to be homosexual. If the maxim were to ‘follow your own orientation’, then it would seem universalizable.\n\nThree postulates – Freedom, Immortality, God.\nBDSM -  Kant would disagree with BDSM and that we cannot consent to such acts. This is because –  Nature of law - we should follow a duty that we think everyone should do and follow. This is unlikely  Treat everyone to an end to themselves - Both must be committed to such acts and individuals should not be used for one's satisfaction. Must be equally agreed upon. (violent acts removed human dignity)  Kingdom of Ends - committing to something we think everyone should do. This is controversial.",
