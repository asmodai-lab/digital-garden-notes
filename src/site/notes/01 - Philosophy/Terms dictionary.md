| Consequent                                         | what follows from a statement. It rains-> **it is wet**                                                                                                  |
| Antecedent                                         | What precedes a statement. **It rains**-> it is wet                                                                                                      |
| Disjunct(ion)                                      | In the sentence 'it is sunny or it is warm', 'or' is the disjunct. Notated as ∨. A ∨ B is true if A, B, or both are true: not if both are false.         |
| Predicate                                          | A quality of something                                                                                                                                   |
| Syllogistic                                        | applies deductive reasoning to reach a conclusion which is reliant on two propositions which are assumed or asserted to be true.                         |
| agreagate                                          |                                                                                                                                                          |
| Conjunction effect                                 | assuming adding extra details to a sentence makes it appear more likely                                                                                  |

| indicative conditional                             | an 'if' sentence used to talk about what may be reality; *'if Leona is at home, she isn't in Paris.'*                                                    |
| Material conditional<br>(aka material implication) | The logical formula P -> Q is true, unless P is true and Q is false. The symbol is '->'                                                                  |
| Counterfactual conditionals                        | Sentences that describe what would have been true if the circumstances had been different: 'if Peter believed in ghosts, he would be afraid to be here.' |
| □                                                  | It is necessary that                                                                                                                                     |

| ¬                                                  | the statement ¬A is only true if A is false.                                                                                                             |

**Ontology-**

**Epistemology**-
A theory of knowledge

**Epiphenomenalism**-
Epiphenomenalism is a philosophical theory on the mind–body problem in the philosophy of mind. It holds that subjective mental events are completely dependent for their existence on corresponding physical and biochemical events within the human body, but do not themselves influence physical events.

Eternal is **existing outside of time**

Everlasting is **existing as long as time exists** 

**Theism**
refers to the view that there is a God that is omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent, who created the world and who is still actively involved in the world.

**Meaningless**
