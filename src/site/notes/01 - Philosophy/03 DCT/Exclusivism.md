## Introduction
Only faith in Jesus Christ and the Christian God can lead to salvation and eternal life because:
1. <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> nobody</span> can <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">reach God</span> through their <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">own efforts</span>
2. Jesus was God, thus Christianity is <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">superior</span>
3. Religions say different things: <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">not all of them can be right.</span>
- other religions <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">wrongly present</span> <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">false paths to salvation,</span> and — depending on the form of exclusivism —<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> may well lead to condemnation</span>.
- in modern times, the <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">wider range of beliefs</span> that many people are exposed to (as a result of globalisation) mean that many Christians are <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">reluctant to endorse exclusivist attitudes</span>, which may be seen as <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">intellectually ignorant.</span>

| This view narrows down salvation to being only available for:<br>> Bible believing Christians (meaning you are a certain view of scripture) OR<br>> People belonging to a particular denomination OR<br>> Augustine/Calvin: election through grace, i.e. God chooses who will be saved. | All people who accept Christ through faith are saved regardless of denomination.<br><br>There may be some who believe that truth can be found in other religions, but only partial truth: which is not enough for salvation. |
## Gavin D'Costa
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Costa</span> proposes a distinction between different forms of <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Christian Exclusivism.</span>

### Restrictive Access Exclusivism
-> Emphasises tradition Christian teachings of limited election; that salvation only comes to the elect, who hear the gospel, who are baptised and accept Jesus as the unique Son of God.

#### God's grace and faith
- Exclusivist attitudes are often associated with <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Calvin</span> and<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> Luther,</span> in their <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">strong adherence to human beings as wholly corrupt</span> due to the Fall, and thus <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">only able to achieve salvation</span> from a free act of <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">grace by God</span>.
- linked to the <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Augustinian</span> notion that<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> fallen human nature</span> was <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">restored </span>through<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> unique sacrifice of Christ</span>
- as humanity is fallen as sinful, it is <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">only those who hear the gospel</span> (<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Fides ex auditu</span>) <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">and respond</span> to the gospel who <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">can be saved</span>; those who have <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">never had the opportunity</span> to hear the gospel will<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> not be saved</span>, as <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">nobody deserves salvation anyway.<br></span>
> [!quote] "I am the way, the truth and the life, <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">no one comes to the Father except through me.</span>" (John 14)

> [!quote] "There is salvation in <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">no one else.</span>" (Acts 4:12)

- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"><b>Hendrik Kraemer</b></span>: affirms a <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">strong theocentric Christ</span> who is the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> only source of revelation about God </span>— general revelation and natural theology (conscience, nature) <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">cannot give true</span> or consistent<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> knowledge of God</span>'s being and nature. 
	- <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">humankind</span> as a whole is fallen and <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">corrupt</span>, and has <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">lost the ability</span> to<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> sense the divine</span> -> we <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">require God's grace</span> and mediation through Christ to achieve salvation through "restoration"

#### Jesus
- Emphasis on the importance of <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">Jesus as God incarnate and so carrying authority of the divine</span>
- it is through this<span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)"> unique role as mediator between God and Earth</span> that exclusivists assert that it is<span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)"> only through Jesus </span>that one can achieve salvation

#### Church
- for many years the Catholic Church took the view that there was extra **<span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">ecclesiam nulla sullas</span>** (no salvation outside of the Church)
- Importance of the Church reaffirmed in the Catechism where it is declared that <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">salvation comes from Christ (the head) through the Church (the body.)</span> 

#### Condemnation
- Exclusivism has been criticised for the implicit idea that <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">those who do not have faith in Christ will be punished, regardless of the lives they lived</span>
- However, in line with single predestination, many have defended exclusivist theology, arguing that it does not necessarily entail condemnation for those unwittingly outside the Christian faith
	- -> **R. C. Sproul** argues that <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">God only punishes those who willingly turn their back against Jesus</span> as the path to salvation

#### The Bible
- Focuses on the <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">Bible as authentic</span> and a source of true knowledge about the world and God —<span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)"> "Biblical realism"</span>
- To <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">deny exclusivism</span> is to<span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)"> deny a literal interpretation</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">direct truthfulness of biblical scripture.</span> 

#### Truth
- although respectful of other religions, they only <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">"often reflect a ray of that Truth"</span>, -> these religions lack the necessary <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">'controlling beliefs'</span> and cannot be means of salvation
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)"><b>Dominus Jesus (2000)</b></span> — declares that the Catholic Church is the one true Church of Christ,<span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)"> unicity conveys the oneness of Christ in Catholicism</span> and the fullness of salvation; while <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">Protestant churches</span> have not been "deprived of significance and importance in the mystery of salvation, they do<span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)"> "suffer from defects."</span>
- other religions <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">may satisfy some necessary conditions but they cannot fulfil them all</span> — seen as inclusive in a sense
- since the 1960s they have acknowledged that other religions hold aspects of the truth, <span style="color:rgb(255, 77, 77)">but full truth can only be found in Catholicism</span>
