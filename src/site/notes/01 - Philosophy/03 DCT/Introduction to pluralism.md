## Exclusivism
Exclusivism says that Christianity is the *only* way to be saved.

Exclusivism makes sense in the context of some Christian teachings. For example, if [[01 - Philosophy/03 DCT/Augustine/Augustine and human nature\|Augustine's teachings on human nature]] are correct, then all humans are doomed without Jesus' sacrifice on the cross — no matter how good a life they live.

Orthodox Christianity teaches us that it is <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Jesus' sacrifice (and our acceptance of it) </span>*alone* <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">that redeems us</span>, not our actions. As such, this interpretation leaves <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">no room for salvation except through Jesus</span>.

Supporters of Christian exclusivism will also point to the following verse to support exclusivism:

> [!quote] John 14 : 6
> *'Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.'*

## Inclusivism
Christian inclusivism says that Christianity is normative — i.e. the right/correct way to be saved, but that **anonymous Christians** — i.e. people who are *not* Christians but are seeking the truth and, in theory, open to God's grace, may also be saved.

Inclusivism makes sense when you consider that many people throughout history wouldn't have even *heard* of Christianity, and so would have never been able to explicitly accept Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. 

Catholic theologian Karl Rahner also makes the following points in support of inclusivism:
1. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Heroes of the Old Testament </span>— such as Abraham and Moses — would surely be saved. But, they wouldn't have been able to accept Jesus' sacrifice because they lived before the birth of Jesus.
2. In<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> Acts 17</span>,<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> Paul travels to Athens</span> and talks with people who haven't yet heard about Jesus. Paul sees an altar inscribed<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> "To The Unknown God"</span> and tells the people of Athens that<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> this 'unknown' god they worship is, in fact, the Christian God.</span>
	- Rahner interprets this as that the people of Athens were doing the right thing up to that point<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> based on the information they had available</span> — they were *anonymous Christians* — and could be saved. But, <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">once presented with the Christian message by Paul, their ignorance would no longer be a valid excuse</span>, and they would have to accept Jesus to be saved. 

## Pluralism
Christian pluralism argues that there are <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">many ways to be saved</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Christianity is just one of these ways</span>.

A parable often used to illustrate pluralism is the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> blind men and the elephant:</span>

> [!example] The parable of the blind men and the elephant
> A group of blind men, who have never encountered an elephant, try to learn what an elephant is by touching it. Each man touches a different part of the elephant's body — one it's tusk, one it's leg, and so on — and so each man has a different image of the elephant in their mind. 
> 
> In some way, all these ideas are accurate, but they are also limited in various different ways. In this parable, the elephant represents God, and the different men represent different religions.

Pluralism makes sense in the context of a multicultural, multi-faith society. John Hick makes the following points in support of pluralism:
- There are <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">equally good </span>(and bad) <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">people of all religions</span>, which suggests that<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> Christianity doesn't have a monopoly on morality.</span>
	- Hick became a pluralist partly as a result of living in multi-faith Birmingham
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> Religious experiences</span> are<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> common</span> to people from different faiths all over the world. And like William James, Hick believes that people<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> interpret these religious experiences</span> differently <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">according </span>to the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">cultural beliefs</span> of their society.
- Immanuel Kant distinguishes between the *noumenon* (<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">the thing itself</span>) and the *phenomenon* (<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">how we experience the thing</span>). We <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">can never experience</span> the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">noumenon</span>, only the phenomenon. 
	- applied to religion, Hick says that different<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> religions</span> are <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">different phenomenal ways</span> of experiencing the same noumenon.

| **Conflicting evidence**  | Several Bible verses suggest that Jesus' sacrifice was for all humanity, not just Christians.<br><br>For example: "Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life *for all people*." - Romans 5:18<br><br>"This is why we labour and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of *all people*, and *especially* those who believe." - Timothy 4:10<br><br>**Reply:** This goes against Christian orthodoxy. Plus, there are verses that support exclusivism. |
| **Problem of hell**       | Christian exclusivism potentially undermines God's omnibenevolence and raises the above issue.<br><br>A person born in India, for example, might have been a Christian had they been born in Europe. Would an omnibenevolent God really punish such a person — *potentially for all eternity* — simply for being born into the 'wrong' religion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Negative consequences** | For example, Dawkins argues that the certainty of religious belief leads to war.<br><br>If you are so certain that your belief is right, and that God is on *your* side and against everyone else, then this may motivate you to treat those of other religions as evil and wrong. (I.e. the crusades.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Issues with inclusivism
**Conflicting evidence:**
- several Bible verses can be said to support an exclusivist, rather than an inclusivist interpretation of Christianity, such as John 14:6. 
- **Reply:** but there are more verses to support inclusivism, such as the examples in Acts 17 of anonymous Christians, and — especially — Timothy 4:10
