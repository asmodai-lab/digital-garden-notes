**Revolutionary [[01 - Philosophy/03 DCT/Gender and Society/Feminism\|Feminist]] theology**
- wants to totally revolutionize Christian theology; it advocates worship of Goddess and woman centred culture among other things. A male centred God is problematic and Christianity is irredeemable. 
**Reformist feminist theology**
- advocates modest changes in the current church structure, usually believes in the more traditional aspects of Christian theology but oppose gender bias and unequal power

### Jesus' challenge to the male warrior

Jesus was not the traditional warrior who was expected. Jesus does not bring the expected military victory of the male Messiah. He reflects nationalist revenge mythology of the Davidic Messiah and envisions a time when all human needs are met and people live in harmony without the need for a strong, domineering leader to protect them. 
- "He is expected to win, not to suffer and die."
	- Jesus is a servant kind. He focuses on serving, not ruling
		- He is critical of reigning powers
		- he calls local religious lawyers hypocrites
		- he warns disciples about lording power over others
		- he washes the feet of the disciples

### Jesus as the incarnation of wisdom

Reuther says;
> Theologically, 'Logos' (the word before he was made man in Jesus) plays the same cosmological roles as Sophia as the ground of creation, revealer of the mind of God, and reconciler of humanity to God
