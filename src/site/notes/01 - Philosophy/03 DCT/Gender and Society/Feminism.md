The self
>Conscientization
>*In feminist theology, one validates ones experiences. The experiences of women have been negated or downplayed by the patriarchal structure. To this end one is also sensitive to the experiences of others that are different from one's own is. Patriarchy and andro-centrism (male-centeredness)* *are sins. When people suffer because of their race, ethnicity, gender, class, age, status, sexual orientation is sin. Therefore, social location is very important.*

[[01 - Philosophy/03 DCT/Gender and Society/Simone De Beauvoir\|Jane Butler]]
- gender performativity, that we are all performing gender rather than being that gender.

**[[01 - Philosophy/03 DCT/Gender and Society/Simone De Beauvoir\|Simone De Beauvoir]]**
- 'one is not born a woman, but becomes one'

## Hermeneutics
-> the Bible is interpreted in light of whether or not it liberates women and men. If the text does not liberate then "it either must not be true or has been misinterpreted." The Hermeneutics (interpretation) or the Bible and church practices are "detecting" patriarchal and androgynous tendencies. Therefore, one looks at language, depictions of women and men, parables, etc. In light of women's liberation from oppression and to the end of empowering women.
