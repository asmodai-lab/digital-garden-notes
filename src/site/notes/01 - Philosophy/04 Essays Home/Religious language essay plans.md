| Strong v weak                      | Weak verification solves the problems of hard verificationism — where we cannot prove something immediately.                                               | This widens the weak principle's applications to the point of becoming meaningless, if one can theoretically imagine the observation-conditions.                                                                                                                                                               | It's not sufficient to merely 'imagine' the relative conditions, we need to know how in principle we could access them.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Hick's Eschatological verification | Hick argues that religious language is verifiable in principle, because we will discover after death if there is an afterlife and God.                     | An issue is that the afterlife is not verifiable in principle. Ayer knew that the dark side of the moon existed, and that a rocket could go there and make observations. We don't know that the afterlife is a place, which exists, where one might find the observer conditions to verify religious language. | If death is annihilation, there won't be a moment of realisation that religious language is false. It can therefore only be proven true, but never false, so the conditions don't properly exist. This solves the imagination problem, because it established empirical evidence as paramount. |
| Own test                           | Ayer responds by admitting that the verification principle cannot be a factual statement. However, he argues that it's not a statement at all, but a tool. | One can deny the verification principle without contradiction, and since it has no evidence, it fails both of it's own test. If it's an empirical statement about how meaning functions, it just seems false. People find all sorts of non-verifiable language meaningful.                                     | This defence completely undermines verification, though. After this defence, Ayer can't say that non empirical statements are categorically meaningless, only meaningless to the tools of empirical observation.                                                                               |

| Mitchell v Flew | Flew attacks Mitchell's claim that theistic belief is falsifiable by some type or amount of evil. He invokes the logical problem evil. This would show that **any** amount of evil falsifies belief in God. Theists thus fail to acknowledge the falsification of their belief, which is what Mitchell argues.<br><br>Also, Mitchell argues that religious belief can be falsified because there is evidence both for and against. However, this evidence 'for' is encounter or experience of God, so not valid empirical evidence | However, Flew relies on the contested logical problem of evil — take the Free Will defence. However, if we turn to the evidentiary problem of evil, this version does not imply that any amount of evil disproves God.           | Mitchell shows that religious belief is sensitive to evidence, based on personal experience and therefore falsifiable. People really do abandon faith due to evil, so a belief can be falsifiable even if it cannot be imagined false in advance.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Hare v Flew     | Hare accuses Flew of making a category error — religious language isn't an attempt to describe reality, but a non-cognitive expression of our 'blik'. Rational thinking about God that seems cognitive is just rationalising our emotions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Flew counters by arguing that theists intent to express cognitive beliefs — see the cosmological argument. We can doubt the soundness of the argument, but one could argue that this isn't just an express of personal feelings. | It's a bit too far to call us a 'slave' to our passions, as Hare argues. We can clearly sometimes control our emotional habits. Psychologist Jonathan Haidt argued that Humean psychology went too far — Our reason, like the rider of an elephant, is often dragged around by emotions but can still exert control.<br><br>Talk of God can still be cognitive language, then — especially in the case of argumentation. |
