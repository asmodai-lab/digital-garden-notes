> [!info] For a statement to be meaningful, it must be verifiable

To be verifiable, we must be able to know under what conditions will something be either<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)"> true</span> or <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">false</span>. 

## The context
### Hegel
![Pasted image 20260120123132.png](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020260120123132.png)
Hegel is a German philosopher who is incredibly fucking important to philosophy. His ideas have dominated European philosophy since he was there.
- he argued that<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> all reality is one</span>: a universe in which everything ultimately forms <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">part of a spiritual reality</span> — the Absolute
- he emphasises the idea of progress and believes that the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> universe is in a continual state of improvement</span> (aka the Hegelian Dialect — see below.)
![synthesis.png](/img/user/05%20-%20Images/synthesis.png)
#### The reaction to Hegel
WW1 made people deeply question the Hegelian Dialect idea: clearly we weren't improving, we just unlocked <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">a whole new level of human suffering!</span>

##### Logical positivism
Originated in the work of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Vienna Circle</span> — a group of philosophers with mathematical and scientific background who met in Vienna in the 1920s and 1930s. Followed the thinking of Auguste Comte.

Their aim was to look at how we use language as a means of conveying knowledge.

## Ayer and the verification principle
> [!example] Their first principle is that talk of 'God' is meaningless

**Fundamental principle:** only those propositions that can be verified empirically have meaning.
> [!quote] 'The meaning of a proposition is the method of verification'
- since all knowledge about the world is based on experience, this should also determine what counts as meaningful
- the true task of philosophy is to<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> clarify whether propositions are meaningful</span>
	- i.e. is they make sense
- it is **not** to determine <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">whether a proposition is true or false.</span>

### Definitions
#### Analytic propositions
> true by definition or tautology
> > Tautologies are circular arguments and give us no new info, so are non cognitive.
> > 
> > e.g. 'bachelors are unmarried men' 'a straight line is the shortest distance between two points', etc.

These are necessarily true: to deny the propositions within the statements would be a contradiction. This is because these are **a priori.**

#### Synthetic propositions
> proved true by sense experience — i.e. empirical statements.
> > 'my coat is wet' (proved true/false by toughing the coat)
> > 
> > or scientific testing

The statement:
> "Elephants are pink and have green toenails."

is meaningful, although untrue: because it can be tested by observation. In contrast, the statement:
> "All wicked people will come to a bad end."

Is not meaningful, because it is impossible to test. This is because they are **a posteriori.**

> [!summary] This is the verification principle
> We know the meaning of a statement if we know the conditions under which the statement is true or false. If it is impossible to know how to prove the statement true or false, it is illogical — so therefore meaningless.

### Summary of his beliefs
Ayer is a key figure of the logical positivist movement, and the creator of the **verification principle.** The principle means that a statement is only meaningful if it is either:
1. **an analytic truth**: things such as mathematical statements and things that are true by definition (a bachelor is an unmarried man).
2. **verifiable** (*aka synthetic truth*): there is some observation or test (at least, in principle) that would prove the statement true. For example, even if the technology didn't exist yet, you could *in principle* meaningfully say: "there is water on Mars," because you could send a spaceship to find out.

> > 	 Or, "all leopards have spots,"
> > These are still meaningful because they are verifiable **in principle**, although not in practice: as we lack the ability to see every piece of metal being heated or to see all leopards.

## Strong and Weak verification 
### Strong verification
> there is no doubt that a statement is true because one can verify it using sense experience or observation
> > "Mary has red hair," could be proved true or false by visiting Mary.

However, this form of verification would exclude many things — like "all human beings are mortal," — which is impossible to demonstrate via strong verification without killing everyone who lives now and will every live.
- even so, few would doubt that statement, right?
	- there's a reason why it's the 'theory of gravity' and the 'theory of evolution' — because, technically, there could be an experiment one day that disproves it.

### Weak verification
> statements that can be verified by observation and evidence obtained **at the time,** which can then be relied on by others.
> > e.g. Columbus discovered America, which was accepted as true because people confirmed it at the time.
> Any proposition that experience suggested was **probably true.**

#### Later modifications
Ayer later modified his definition of the verification principle and rejected strong verification, as he reasoned that:
>[!quote] "no statement could meet the criteria of the strong verification principle."

Because we can never conclusively make a statement about the world, **because our senses can be mistaken,** even about what we think is in front of us.
> I may be mistaken about whether my cat is in front of me as a I really see her; but I cannot get outside my mind to check whether my perception agrees with the facts. 
> >Because of my weakness in eyesight, I might mistake my neighbour's cat for my own.

Strong verification means that historical and scientific conclusions would be unverifiable. 

In fact, every factual statement would be meaningless, because nothing could be conclusively true.
- whereas anything can be supported using the weak verification principle.

##### Direct and indirect verification
**Direct**: statements that you can observe and therefore verify.
> "the sky is blue."

**Indirect**: statements which can be verified if there is no other directly verifiable evidence to support it.
> "there are black holes in space," can't be directly observed, but other evidence suggests their existence.

## Why is talk of God meaningless?

> [!question] Questions
> 1. Why might Logical Positivists argue that 'God exists' is *not* a tautology?
> 2. Why is the statement 'God hears me,' meaningless?
> 3. Is any statement regarding God factually meaningless, because God is referred to as a metaphysical being who is ineffable & transcendent?

Statements about God are meaningless (*according to Ayer*) because there is no method for their verification — they don't tell us anything about the world that is verifiable.

It's not possible to know the conditions under which propositions about God can be proved true or false: so such talk must be meaningless.

The proposition 'there is a god' is:
1. not analytic — can't be verified by the internal logic of the statement
2. not synthetic — can't be verified by external empirical evidence
C₁: talk of 'God' is meaningless. Just because the word 'God' exists, does not mean that there is a corresponding reality.

### The implications of the principle on religious language
As far as Ayer is concerned, both theists and atheists are talking nonsense.
- sense is not a given by adding a negative
Agnosticism also makes no sense because there are asking the question: "is there a God?" which is meaningless

Religious faith is nonsense, religious experience is nonsense. All discussion on the issue is nonsense, to Ayer.
> Dawkins treats religious belief as failed scientific hypotheses, devoid of proof. Ayer wouldn't even waste his time trying to disprove faith in the first place.
