> [!info] For a statement to be meaningful, it must be verifiable

To be verifiable, we must be able to know under what conditions will something be either true or false. 

## The context
### Hegel
![Pasted image 20260120123132.png](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020260120123132.png)
Hegel is a German philosopher who is incredibly fucking important to philosophy. His ideas have dominated European philosophy since he was there.
- he argued that all reality is one: a universe in which everything ultimately forms part of a spiritual reality — the Absolute
- he emphasises the idea of progress and believes that the universe is in a continual state of improvement (aka the Hegelian Dialect — see below.)

#### The reaction to Hegel
WW1 made people deeply question the Hegelian Dialect idea: clearly we weren't improving, we just unlocked a whole new level of human suffering!

##### Logical positivism
Originated in the work of the Vienna Circle — a group of philosophers with mathematical and scientific background who met in Vienna in the 1920s and 1930s. Followed the thinking of Auguste Comte.

Their aim was to look at how we use language as a means of conveying knowledge.

> They weren't trying to offer a world view of their own. They believed that if you wanted to know about the universe, ask a scientist.

> the philosopher's task is to analyse the structure of a sentence and decide whether it is meaningful
> >[!warning] This does not mean that they are deciding whether something is true or false, but if it is meaningful — i.e. makes sense, i.e. can be verified.



### Ayer

Ayer is a key figure of the logical positivist movement, and the creator of the **verification principle.** The principle means that a statement is only meaningful if it is either:
1. **an analytic truth**: things such as mathematical statements and things that are true by definition (a bachelor is an unmarried man).
2. **verifiable** (*aka synthetic truth*): there is some observation or test (at least, in principle) that would prove the statement true. For example, even if the technology didn't exist yet, you could *in principle* meaningfully say: "there is water on Mars," because you could send a spaceship to find out.
