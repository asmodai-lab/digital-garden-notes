### Definitions
**Analytical statements** — a statement which is true by definition and needs no outside clarification. (*related to deductive arguments*)

**Synthetic statements** — a statement which adds something to our understanding, and so has to be experienced to know if it is true or not. (*related to inductive arguments*)

**Predicate** — a distinctive characteristic of something

**Deductive arguments**
> P1: all cows are mammals
> P2: Tabitha is a cow
> C1: therefore, Tabitha is a mammal

The conclusion is the inevitable result of the premises. This is a deductive argument.

**Inductive arguments**
> P1: 4 people go out for a meal, and all choose the same meal.
> P2: all 4 were sick afterwards
> C1: there was something wrong with the food

This argument is only probably true, not true beyond all doubt, so it is therefore inductive.
