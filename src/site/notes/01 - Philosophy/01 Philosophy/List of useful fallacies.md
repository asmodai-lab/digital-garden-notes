## Useful terminology

| Term                                               | Meaning                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consequent                                         | what follows from a statement. It rains-> **it is wet**                                                                                                  |
| Antecedent                                         | What precedes a statement. **It rains**-> it is wet                                                                                                      |
| Disjunct(ion)                                      | In the sentence 'it is sunny or it is warm', 'or' is the disjunct. Notated as ∨. A ∨ B is true if A, B, or both are true: not if both are false.         |
| Predicate                                          | A quality of something                                                                                                                                   |
| Syllogistic                                        | applies deductive reasoning to reach a conclusion which is reliant on two propositions which are assumed or asserted to be true.                         |
| agreagate                                          |                                                                                                                                                          |
| Conjunction effect                                 | assuming adding extra details to a sentence makes it appear more likely                                                                                  |
| Non sequitur                                       | the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise.                                                                                                |

| indicative conditional                             | an 'if' sentence used to talk about what may be reality; *'if Leona is at home, she isn't in Paris.'*                                                    |
| Material conditional<br>(aka material implication) | The logical formula P -> Q is true, unless P is true and Q is false. The symbol is '->'                                                                  |
| Counterfactual conditionals                        | Sentences that describe what would have been true if the circumstances had been different: 'if Peter believed in ghosts, he would be afraid to be here.' |
| □                                                  | It is necessary that                                                                                                                                     |

## Formal Fallacies
(A formal fallacy is an error in the argument's form — i.e. from A -> B, and the '->' contains the fallacy)

### Assumptions made
#### Existential Fallacy
In [the existential fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_fallacy), one presupposes that a class (of thing) has members when one is not supposed to do so. This fallacy is a categorical syllogism, because it has two universal premises and a particular conclusion with no assumption that at least one member of the class exists, an assumption which is not established by the premises.

This fallacy does not occur with enthymemes (arguments reliant on a hidden premise, often one that is taken from the audience's worldview), where hidden premises required to make the syllogism valid assume the existence of at least one member of the class.
- don't confuse this with affirming the consequent (If A, then B. B, therefore A.)

> [!EXAMPLE] Example 1
> P₁ : all trespassers will be prosecuted
> C₁ : ∴ some of those prosecuted will have trespassed. 
> > This is a fallacy because P₁ does not require the existence of real trespassers, and so does not prove the existence of any. **Note that this is a fallacy regardless of whether anyone trespassed.**

> [!EXAMPLE] Example 2
> P₁ : every unicorn has a horn on its forehead
> If P₁ is true, somewhere there is a unicorn in the world (with a horn on it's forehead.)





## Informal Fallacies
(an informal fallacy is one which is based on faulty premises.)

## Non-logic based fallacies
(most of these are technically informal fallacies, but they are quite different, in that they are most commonly heard whilst actually debating a topic with real people — usually stupid people.)
