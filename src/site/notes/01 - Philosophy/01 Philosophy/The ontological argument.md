## The proponents of the ontological argument

### Paul Tillich (unnecessary but useful)
> P₁ : Existence is a predicate of things/beings which are created.
> P₂ : God is not something which was created
> C₁ : to talk of God's 'existence' is implying that God was created — i.e. on the same level as finite objects

Therefore:

> > P₁ : God is not a 'being'
> > C₁ : God is 'being' itself

- For Tillich, religious belief is more than just agreeing to a set of statements. If we compare religious belief to love: there is always an element of uncertainty, which is the same for knowing God.
- For this to be the case, God must be partially hidden from the world in order to maintain epistemic distance
	- this is necessary for humans to have genuinely free will

### Anselm
#### Context
Anselm is not trying to convince an atheist or doubter of God's existence.

He is responding to the opening of a Psalm passage:
- 'the fool says to himself "there is no God"'
Anselm is trying to prove how foolish it must be to think that there is no God.
- he also thinks that faith must precede understanding.
	- 'faith seeking understanding'
- aka: **what kind of being does the word 'God' refer to?**

#### His argument
Anselm defines God as : 'That which nothing greater can be conceived' (TWNGCBC) — or 'something which nothing greater can be thought of'

His argument is thus:
> P₁ : TWNGNBC is the greatest
> C₁ : this being must be something more than existing merely in people's thoughts / this being cannot be restricted by non-existence

OR
> P₁ : God is TWNGCBC
> P₂ : if God exists in the mind alone, then a greater being could be imagined existing in both the mind and in reality
> C₁ : this being would therefore be greater than God
> C₂ : thus, God cannot exist only as an idea in the mind if God is TWNGCBC
> C₃ : God must exist in both the mind and reality

##### Some definitions
**Necessarily true statements** (tautologies) cannot be false, and necessarily false statements cannot be true.

**Contingent statements** can be either true or false depending on facts, evidence and circumstance.

> **Contingent beings**: beings whose existence are neither necessary nor impossible — both their existence and nonexistence are logically possible.
> 
> **Necessary beings**: beings who cannot *not* exist. Opposite to impossible beings (things whose existence is contradictory — like round squares) which cannot exist.


##### Anselm's second form argument
(this is just using the definitions from earlier)
- also, quickly note that 'God' for Anselm has no prior predicates. He is just using the word 'God' as TWNGCBC

> P₁ : God is TWNGCBC
> P₂ : it is greater to be a necessary being (which cannot not-exist) than a contingent being (which can not-exist)
> > P₃ : if God is only contingent (therefore can not-exist), then a greater being could be imagined that is not contingent
> C₁ : this being would be greater than God, and so God would not be TWNGCBC
> > C₂ : God is therefore a necessary being

#### Criticisms
##### Gaunilo's imaginary island
Gaunilo argued that is someone were to describe to you a 'most perfect island' and then state that it must exist because it is perfect, then you would be a fool to believe him. You cannot move from thought to reality.

Anselm's response would be restating his argument — focussing on the *necessity* of God.
- i.e. God cannot not-be
	- for why, refer to P₃, C₁ and C₂ in his second form argument.

> [!TIP] Extra long explanation for those who don't get it
> God is eternal and always has been — so, not limited by time.
> > it would be a logical contradiction to claim that God does not exist, since any being who has the property of necessary existence could not fail to exist
> 
> 

**A possible rebuttal to Anselm:**

This response is misunderstanding Gaunilo's criticism. His criticism is that you **cannot define something into existence, no matter what it is.** Just because the island is not a necessary being, does not make it not a good example. 
- Gaunilo is saying that it would be ridiculous to say that, because an island is a necessary being, it cannot not-exist. This is his comparison to God. 

##### Aquinas' criticisms
Aquinas thinks that Anselm's arguments cannot apply to existence. 
> [!EXAMPLE] For example
> if a person says that truth does not exist:
> - the statement is nonsense, because nobody can conceive of Truth not-existing unless truth does not exist at all
> - it is a contradiction in terms to say that truth does not exist (because you cannot truthfully say it)
> - but when we talk of God existing, it is also possible to conceive of God not existing

**Also, Aquinas questions Anselm's terms:**

_‘that which nothing greater can be conceived’-_ Aquinas questions this because he says the finite human mind cannot know everything about God: to a certain extent, God is unknowable.

**Just because something** is universally shared, does not mean that this something exists in reality; there has to be more than just a definition to show the existence of God.
- we need evidence, rather than just argument
- also, Aquinas thinks that not everyone who hears the name God understands it to signify TWNGCBC. The term God is somewhat ambiguous.
- arguments for God must be **causal**, based on effects that one can see, and from that deduce that ' a god ' must be required to cause this

##### Kant's criticisms (the existential fallacy)

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



#### Existential Fallacy
In [the existential fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_fallacy), one presupposes that a class (of thing) has members when one is not supposed to do so. This fallacy is a categorical syllogism, because it has two universal premises and a particular conclusion with no assumption that at least one member of the class exists, an assumption which is not established by the premises.

This fallacy does not occur with enthymemes (arguments reliant on a hidden premise, often one that is taken from the audience's worldview), where hidden premises required to make the syllogism valid assume the existence of at least one member of the class.
- don't confuse this with affirming the consequent (If A, then B. B, therefore A.)

> [!EXAMPLE] Example 1
> P₁ : all trespassers will be prosecuted
> C₁ : ∴ some of those prosecuted will have trespassed. 
> > This is a fallacy because P₁ does not require the existence of real trespassers, and so does not prove the existence of any. **Note that this is a fallacy regardless of whether anyone trespassed.**

> [!EXAMPLE] Example 2
> P₁ : every unicorn has a horn on its forehead
> If P₁ is true, somewhere there is a unicorn in the world (with a horn on it's forehead.)

> [!NOTE] Note
> Kant coined the term 'ontological argument'
> > i.e. an argument relying on the meaning of words and logic
> > > ontology attempts to answer such questions as 'what is real?' It is the study of reality.

###### Kant's first criticism
**Existence is not a real predicate.**
> Existence does not tell us what an object is like, but simply states an actuality.
> > it doesn't add anything to a concept.
> >> the real contains no more than the possible.
> >
> > the concept of God is not made greater by adding reality.
> 
> C₁ : so, the argument that the greatest being must exist is weak.

Just because you can define something analytically, does not make it real. 
- we can accept the definition of a triangle, or a mountain, or other things (triangle must have three sides, and three angles not summing to more that 180, and a mountain must have a valley, etc)
	- but this does not make it so the triangle, or the mountain, exist in reality.
- **it is only those who believe in God who think that his existence is a necessity.**
>[!QUOTE]
>'*to posit a triangle, and yet to reject it's three angles, is self-contradictory; but there is no contradiction in rejecting the triangle together with it's three angles.*

Another example;
- a unicorn has a horn
	- but **just because you can define something, doesn't make it real.**

###### Kant's second criticism
He does agree that there are some sentences in which a subject cannot be thought of without the predicate.
> He agrees that 2 + 2 = 4

However, the existence of God is not one of them because we can think of God not existing — for God, existence is not a predicate.
> [!WARNING] This entire bit is very similar to his first criticism in substance, but it's still a useful analogy to remember.

You do not add anything to the existence of an object by saying that it is real, not imaginary. Kant used an analogy of coins/*thalers* to explain this.
> A pile of 100 coins/thalers is the same as 100 coins/thalers in one's imagination.
> C₁ : since existence does not add anything to the coins, existence is not a predicate, and we cannot make exceptions with God.

The real contains no more than the mere possibility, whether or not a concept is actualised is an issue, but not an issue that can be resolved simply by adding existence to the different predicates that we are ascribing to our concept.

> *‘The real contains no more than the merely possible. A hundred real coins do not contain the least coin more than a hundred possible coins.’*

However, Kant's monetary criticism has some critics.  Stephen Davis writes:
> *"of the real 100 coins, by concept of them includes the property of 'having purchasing power in the real world. My concept of 100 coins does not have this property."*

This is a fair point. There is, however, a rebuttal (from yours truly):
- if two people agree that 100 imaginary coins has the value of 100 real coins, those coins have purchasing power.
	- and if you say 'that's ridiculous, there's no way a large group of people would do that, and this makes those 100 coins worthless outside of those two people!'
	- are you, perhaps, aware of how money works?
- paper money has no intrinsic value, nor does electronic. It only has value in the fact that we, collectively, as a society, have agreed that it has value.
	- money was originally made of minerals to give it 'intrinsic' value — but even that value is something that we agreed upon, and is not intrinsic to the mineral itself. How much gold costs is completely arbitrary.
- money is, effectively, a collective delusion. That does not, however, make it an irrefutable, unchanging fact of the universe.
	- money is incredibly volatile. It's value changes over time, and it changes form (and therefore use) between countries, despite the fact that it is, in theory, the same thing: **theoretical value that we have collectively agreed to pretend is real for the sake of a functioning bartering system.**
'Existence' does not add anything to the money, because we have already agreed to pretend that it exists despite the fact that it doesn't. The 100 imaginary Thalers could be the same as 100 real Thalers, the only difference is one's own belief in them.

##### Hume's criticism
Hume argues that it's not possible to begin an argument based on logic, and then reach a conclusion based entirely on an observable universe.
- this isn't how we work as humans;
	- we base our lives on things we can observe, not things that we can rationally prove. The things we can rationally prove stay within the mind and have no real impact on our lives.

##### Russel's criticism
> P₁ : statement A: 'the present King of France is bald' is false
> It would be fallacious ([[01 - Philosophy/01 Philosophy/List of useful fallacies#Existential Fallacy\|existentially fallacious]], perhaps) to then assert:
> > If A is false, this means that the statement 'the present King of France is not bald' to be true.
> 
> Neither are true, because there is no such King of France.

Our use of words and the way we apply the predicates is not enough to demonstrate that something exists. 
> if we apply the predicates to something whose existence isn't certain, we can't expect the normal rules of linguistics to apply.

Coming back to the centre of most the critiques of the ontological argument:

>[!info] The action of describing something as existing does not make it exist

Russel uses another example of a faulty argument to support this.
> P₁ : men exist
> P₂ : Santa Claus is a man
> C₁ : Santa Claus exists.

#### Malcolm's rebuttal to the critics
- existence is not a predicate in the contingent kind, but when applied to necessary existence (i.e. God), this rule is different
- 'Necessary existence' is like God's other characteristics: infinite, simple, omni-benevolent, omni-potent, etc.
	- all of these characteristics set God apart.

He argues thus:

> P₁ : If God does not exist today, then he never can and never will: because a being with the greatness of God is uncaused and has no beginning.
> P₂ : if God does exist, then he must exist necessarily; rather than contingently, otherwise he would depend on something else to exist, and therefore not be TWNGCBC
> > C₁ : God's existence is either impossible or necessary: there are no other options
> 
> P₁: God's existence is not impossible. It is not logically contradictory to have the concept of a God who exists — it's a concept we can entertain without any logical absurdity
> C₂: since God's existence is not impossible, the only other option is that he is Necessary: so God exists necessarily.

##### Criticisms of Malcolm
- it might be illogical to say that sometimes there is a God and sometimes there isn't
	- BUT it is not illogical to say that maybe there is and maybe there is not a God
- he still relies on people accepting that God's existence is different to other kinds of existence, so **he is asking us to believe in God as the hidden premise of the argument**
> [!WARNING] This reduces the argument to: God exists necessarily, therefore God exists necessarily
