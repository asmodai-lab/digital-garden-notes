### Major debates
- comparison of the usefulness of the above approaches to religious language
- whether or not the apophatic way enables effective understanding of theological discussion
- whether or not Aquinas’ analogical approaches support effective expression of language about God
- whether or not religious discourse is comprehensible if religious language is understood as symbolic

### An important note

Before you start this topic, you need to understand that the question here is not *at all* related to the question of whether God exists. You must go into this topic assuming that everybody's arguments around this (**unless explicitly stated otherwise**) have their first proposition being:
> P1: God exists.

And usually also:
>P2: this God is abrahamic

----
I also assume that you know what a metaphor (etc) is. If you don't, perhaps go back to primary school.

## What is the problem of religious language?

There are two major problems of religious language. The first is based on the traditional idea of God in the Abrahamic traditions. The second is based entirely on the doctrine of simplicity. What you need to know is the arguments for and against both of these.

#### God in the Abrahamic traditions
The God in the Abrahamic traditions is **incorporeal, infinite, and timeless.** Therefore, it doesn't make sense that the predicates that we apply to humans would also apply to God.

>[!INFO] Predicate definition
> 'to predicate' is to say that something is true. 'To be predicated on something' means that an argument depends on the existence/truth of xyz.
> >The sales forecast is *predicated* on a growing economy.
> 
> A predicate (noun) is defined as 'the part of the sentence that gives information about the subject and contains the verb.'
> >In the sentence "We went to the airport.", "*went to the airport.*" is the predicate.


#### Divine simplicity

>[!WARNING] 
>This section may melt your brain a little bit. It certainly did to me when reading it elsewhere!
>>[!TIP] 
>>If you cannot understand this section no matter what you do, don't worry: I'm overcomplicating it. You only **need** to understand the problem of religious language as: **'how can we meaningfully talk about something that we don't understand?**' Anything else is A* fodder.


Divine simplicity claims that God does not have any *intrinsic, accidental properties.*

**Intrinsic properties** are properties that the loss of such a property by a subject entails a change in that subject.

**Accidental properties** are that if a subject were to acquire or lose an accidental property, the subject would still be a member of it's species.

>Thus, statements such as "God is P" where P is an **intrinsic, accidental** property would be ruled out by divine simplicity.

>*For example, the statement, “Kofi Annan is good,” means that some property goodness is a property of Kofi. When one says, “God is good,” it would appear that this statement means that some property goodness is a property of God. But if the doctrine of divine simplicity is true, it is impossible that God have the intrinsic accidental property of goodness. Rather, God is goodness. That is, God’s essence includes goodness and God is identical with his essence. Consequently, whenever someone applies a positive attribute to God they are speaking falsely, for God does not have properties in the way that creatures have properties.*

This topic is about evaluating the three theories that attempt to solve either of these problems.
### Summary of the issues with cataphatic language

> *"The first time when you seek God, you only find darkness: and as it were a cloud of unknowing... This darkness and this cloud is, whatever you do, between you and God, and... you may not see him clearly by the light of your understanding in your reason... for if ever you shall feel him or see him... it is right always to be in this cloud in this darkness."*
- So, the epistemic gap.

- God is infinite and wholly immaterial and transcendent- so how can 'God talk' tell us real facts about God if he is not a being to which the human language of nouns, adjectives and verbs can apply? ([[01 - Philosophy/01 Philosophy/Religious Language/The apophatic way#God in the Abrahamic traditions\|this is a simplified version of the problems with the traits of God/Abrahamic God]])
	-**So, the epistemic gap.**
- ==**Language is subjective.**== People have different concepts of justice, love, kindness, etc
- It's ==**misleading**==- if we say God is a father or a shepherd, then many people may think that God has a body, or is male, or has faults. What about 'God is love' or 'God is good'? ([[01 - Philosophy/01 Philosophy/Religious Language/The apophatic way#Divine simplicity\|this is a simplified version of Divine Simplicity]])
	- some argue that it is better to accept the mysteries of God than try to pin God down using human/flawed concepts. 

> What I mean by the main question behind the problem of religious language being 'how can we meaningfully talk about something that we do not understand?' — by 'talk about', I mean the cataphatic way.
