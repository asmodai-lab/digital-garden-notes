## Aquinas' criticisms of the cataphatic way

Aquinas thought that usual cataphatic language about God failed to convey any truths about God. This is because of the two ways that words can be used: **univocally** or **equivocally.**

| This fails to speak of God because words we apply to ourselves cannot be thought of applying to God in the same way — when we say God is 'loving' we mean this in a different way as 'humans are loving.' — this is because God is beyond our understanding. | This fails because when words have a completely different meaning, if we don't know that meaning, they become meaningless to apply them to God, especially when we don't know what God is. For example, The word 'loving' applied to God becomes meaningless. |

So, since words can **only** be either univocal or equivocal, the cataphatic way does not manage to say anything about God. 

## His solution — the secret third way

Aquinas proposes that we can still use cataphatic language to talk about God — using neither univocal or equivocal language, but **analogy.**

He has two different analogies that he says we can use to talk about God.
- these are less analogies are more forms of logical reasoning.

### Analogy of attribution

This is the idea that something that is true of a part can be attributed to a whole. To argue this, Aquinas uses the analogy of the Bull (or, as I like to call it, the bull piss analogy)

> [!EXAMPLE] The bull piss analogy
>  If you take a sample of a bull's urine and it is healthy, one can assume — without seeing the bull — that the bull is healthy.

There is also an analogy for the reverse — the baker's bread analogy:
> If the baker is a skilled baker, we can assume that the bread made by the baker is good.

Or, to flip the bull piss analogy
> If you see a healthy bull, you can assume that it's piss is healthy without seeing it's piss.

#### Is this analogy strong?

One can argue that this has a good basis in reality. However, there are some major flaws — some of which are even named fallacies!

1. The fallacy of division
Assuming that because something is true of a whole, it must be true of the parts
2. The fallacy of composition
Assuming that because something is true of the parts, it is true of the whole

Of course, you can't just name a fallacy in an argument and say that it fails. That isn't good arguing, that's just naming things. When using a fallacy, you should properly explain how it's used. Here's one I made earlier:
> <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Aquinas' analogy of attribution is reliant on the analogy of composition; assuming that something true of the parts is true of the whole. While these can be reliable assumptions in most cases — such as in the analogy of the bull — in reality, one must know sufficient information about both subjects (the analogy and the analogized) for this to not be a fallacy. The analogy of the bull only works because Aquinas knows that the health of a bull will — almost always — be reflected in it's urine. Aquinas himself argues that we cannot know an infinite being through a finite lens — which does not change when we change our language, because our lack of knowledge is the problem. Therefore, the analogy of attribution is an unsuccessful way of speaking about God.</span> 

You could, of course, argue the other side by pointing out that just because an argument contains a fallacy, that does not mean that it is false. Aquinas' conclusions do reasonably follow from his propositions — and he isn't arguing that we can have perfect knowledge of God, just that we can speak reasonably about him.

##### Karl Barth's critique
Barth's critique is based on the idea of the Fall — but it can be used without referencing the Fall.

Essentially, his argument is this:
> P1: the analogy of attribution is based on using human reason to talk about God
> P2: because of the Fall, our human reasoning is deeply flawed.
> >Therefore, the analogy of attribution is not reliable for use of talking about God.

>[!QUOTE] "the finite has no capacity for the infinite"

So, whatever we discover through reason cannot be divine — and thinking that it can be is idolatry.

However, Aquinas would argue against this by pointing out that through Grace, we can overcome our sins: in which case our human reasoning is not flawed.

### Analogy of proportion

Aquinas' analogy of proportion is a strange one. It's similar to the idea of scaling an object up or down — only we are doing this with attributes and God.

Take 'life.' Bacteria has life, plants have life, animals have life, and humans have life. But, we'd think of these as different kinds/scales of 'life'. Why can't we just scale this up to God?

If you want another example- take 'love'. A dog 'loves' a human, a child 'loves' a toy, a mother 'loves' her daughter, so why can't God 'love' us — just on a larger scale?

The analogy of proportion is, essentially, taking any given word that we can use to talk about humans, and multiplying it by a factor in order to apply it to God.

The word is our **'model'**. The multiplier is the **'qualifier'**.

#### The way I like to understand it
First, watch 7:56 - 9:00 on this video:

So — a 2D being cannot fully understand a 3D being, right? This is the difference between us and God.

However, the 2D being can still make analogies that get close to understanding this 3D being — like how we can theoretically understand the 4th dimension. We can make analogies to gain a knowledge of it — whilst still knowing that it is above our true understanding.
> for example: imagine showing an alien (who has never seen a human) a drawing of a hand. They have arguably gained a basic understanding of a hand, although not close to a full understanding.

This is what Aquinas' analogy of proportion is. We can understand that a 2D being would not be able to truly understand a 3D being whilst still being able to know things about a 3D being in relation to their own understanding so we can scale that up to ourselves: that we, 3D beings, would not be able to truly understand a 4D being.
> If we use my analogy of the hand drawing: the hand drawing is the model. The knowledge that the model is infinitely lesser than an actual three dimensional hand is the qualifier. 

#### Brummer's critique

Brummer brings up the **problem of accuracy**. 

Think of it like this: for every truth that Aquinas says about God using the analogy of proportion, Brummer asks for more specifics. Attribution can tell us that God has certain qualities but not *in what way* he has those qualities.
- we can attribute everything that we are to God, because God is the source of everything. 
	- but this does not tell us in what way God has these attributes.
	- *Since humans are loving, we can attribute to God love to God. However, we are merely saying that God is the source of love. Analogy does not enable us to say in what way God is loving.*

On one hand, this criticism doesn't account for the fact that Aquinas is **not** saying that the analogy of attribution tells us specific details about God — it only provides a way for our finite minds to gain a basic understanding of God.
- the analogy of proportion, in a way, purposely points out what *we don't know*. That's **the whole point of the qualifier**: to note that any human quality we ascribe to God is so much greater, much more infinite, much more *different* to ourselves; specifically that we cannot fully understand it. 
	- In this way, Brummer's critique fails because this is classic straw-manning

However, you could argue that Brummer's critique succeeds in pointing out that the problem of accuracy isn't actually about the epistemic gap in understanding God, but in actuality *the problem is in trying to understand something of which we know nothing about.*
- for an analogy to work, we often have to know a basic amount about both things: in order to know where the analogy does and doesn't apply.
	- E.g. say 'electricity behaves like water' — i.e. in it's flow and power. But we also understand that this doesn't apply to the danger levels of both substances, their charge, their state of matter etc. 
	- **we do not know these things about God — so any analogy of proportion that we use is going to be so unverifiable and/or inaccurate as to become philosophically meaningless.**
