## Narrow view of meaning
### Assumes only science can tell us about the world
Art and poetry reveal valuable things about human nature, but are neither cognitive or scientifically verifiable. Logical positivism, by reducing all significant language to two categories, leaves no place for non verifiable contributions to human knowledge.

### Religious sentences are not in the same category as scientific sentences
To reduce sentences to two classes — meaningful and meaningless — misrepresents the fulness of either the: range of possible sentences, or of meaning.

### 'Toys in the Cupboard' (Swinburne)
In 'Coherence of Theism', Swinburne argues against logical positivism by claiming that there are sentences that obviously have meaning, but are not verifiable in any way, e.g. toys coming out of the cupboard at night and dancing around -> religious and ethical claims are still of meaning and importance even if they cannot be verified.

> [!warning] Is Swinburne misinterpreting Ayer?
> Ayer does not deny the emotional value of religious statements; what he denies is their verifiability.
> > Although whether verifiability -> meaning/significance... debatably, no.
> We cannot go from: Swinburne's assumption that a statement about toys in a cupboard -> assuming that any statement about God is meaningful in the same way.
> > In Swinburne's sentence, all words are understood through empirical experience, but a sentence about God involves words with **cannot be checked through sense experience**.
> > > These words rely on faith.

### Brummer
**To dismiss the very possibility of God seems to necessitate a particular world-view.** 
- to suggest things are only significant **if** open to scientific investigation is based on it's own metaphysical viewpoint: that the reality of the world is merely based on science.

## Science v Theology
### Emmet
**Theological statements are not as straightforward as scientific ones.** Error of Enlightenment thought to treat natural theology and it's claim univocally — that is, as scientific propositions which are equivalent to those of conventional science. 

Logical positivisms want to look for complete explanations provided by science, when meaning can also come from w=faith, which is not something that can be verified/falsified.

## Fails it's own test
The claim that statements are only meaningful is verifiable is, in itself, an unverifiable claim: it cannot be verified by sense experience. So, ironically, it is self-disproving.

---
Since we can't test the verification principle via sense experience, it isn't synthetic.

If it is analytical, then the problem is that logical positivists have given a new meaning to the word 'meaningful'.

### Practicality problems
- scientifically, not all claims will be verifiable. 
	- like with the existence of black holes
- historical statements are completely non-verifiable. 
	- we can read an account from someone, but that only means that we can decide that the writings are meaningful, not what they are actually describing
- how can we meaningfully describe our thoughts?
	- what about 'I had a weird dream last night' or 'I'm not looking forward to my exams'
- what about poetry, art, music, literature, etc
	- they can describe aspects of human experience, and open up new ways of seeing the world. But, they aren't verifiable.
- even economics, political science, and actual science can fall short of the verification principle.
*Judgements and hypotheses are not proven in the way needed with the principle, but still have meaning.*

### Ayer and Popper's response
**Ayer** responded by claiming that verificationism was a theory, not a statement, so did not need to pass the test.

**Karl Popper** argued that we cannot scientifically verify everything — it's an illogical test of meaning.

## Eschatologically verifiable

### The Celestial city
> [!info] The story of the celestial city
> Two men are travelling together along a road. One of them believes that it leads to the Celestial City, and the other believes that it leads nowhere. But, since this is the only road there is, both must travel it. Neither have been this way before, therefore neither is able to say what they will find around each corner.
> 
> During their journey, they meet with moments of refreshment and delight, and with hardship and danger. All the time, one of them thinks that this journey is a pilgrimage to the Celestial City, and the other sees this journey as an unavoidable and aimless ramble. Yet, when they turn the last corner, it will be apparent that one of them has been right the whole time, and the other wrong.

So, how can this story help to answer the problem of whether religious language can have any meaning, when considered in the light of logical positivism?

#### Hick's claim
Hick tried to suggest that it is possible to verify religious language **after death**, using the Celestial City as an example of this.
- of course, this is difficult to test with our human senses — as the verification principle demands — since we will be different 'beings' after death.
- however, Hick;s point does raise the issue of whether **future statements can be meaningful.**
