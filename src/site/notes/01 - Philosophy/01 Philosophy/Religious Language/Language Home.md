>[!WARNING] What mini-topic is part of what major topic?
>The first part of the religious language topic does NOT contain Wittgenstein, Falsification or Verification. It only contains:
> 1. the basic ideas of the cataphatic way
> 2. a more detailed level for the apophatic way (Maimonides and Pseudo-Dionysus)
> 3. Aquinas' theory of analogy (plus criticisms)
> 4. Tillich's theory of symbolism (plus criticism)
> >*Note that the articles for extra reading are on both Religious language part one AND part two. Only read them once you've done both.*
