## Proponents

The falsification principle, proposed by Karl Popper, is a way of demarcating science from non-science. It suggests that for a theory to be considered scientific, it must be able to be tested and conceivably proven false.

For Popper, science should attempt to disprove a theory rather than attempt to continually support theoretical hypotheses.

Flew takes this further. He says that any statement that fails the Falsification Principle is meaningless.
> A statement is factually significant ONLY if there is some form of evidence which could **falsify** it.
> - you must be able to say what would prove it to be incorrect.

### Thoughts on religious language
Religious language is not falsifiable, because theists are always qualifying their beliefs about God. They shift the goalposts and so religious language becomes meaningless.

This leads to: 

> [!quote] "The death of God by a thousand qualifications" - Flew

#### Parable of the gardener
> [!example] The parable of the gardener (Flew)
> Once upon a time, two explorers came upon a clearing in the jungle. In the clearing were growing many flowers and many weeds. One explorer says, **'Some gardener must tend to this plot.'** The other disagrees, **'There is no gardener.'** So, they pitch their tents and set a watch.
> 
> No gardener is ever seen. **'But perhaps he is an invisible gardener.'** So they set up a barbed-wire fence. They electrify it. They patrol with bloodhounds. But no shrieks ever suggest that some intruder has received a shock. No movements of the wire never betray an invisible climber. The bloodhounds never give cry.
> 
> Yet the Believer is still not convinced. **'But there is a gardener: invisible, intangible, insensible to electric shocks, a gardener who has no scent and makes no sound, and gardener who comes secretly to look after the garden which he loves.'**
> 
> At last the Sceptic despairs: **'But what remains of your original assertion? Just how does what you call an invisible, intangible, eternally elusive gardener differ from an imaginary gardener or even from no gardener at all?'**

- the gardener stands for God, and the garden represents the world. The flowers and weeds stands for what the believer sees as order and design in the universe.
- the Believer represents theists, and the Sceptic represents atheists.
- by the end of all their tests, there is nothing left of the original assertion that there is a gardener — so that assertion has been 'killed by inches.'
- for Flew, the gardener's existence 'dies the death of a thousand qualifications', because every time he fails to be detected, the Believer qualifies what he means by his gardener.

Flew's argument is that the Believer in the parable will allow nothing to falsify his belief that there is a gardener who loves and looks after his garden.
- in the same way, the religious believer will allow nothing to falsify his belief that there is a God who loves and looks after the world.
- statements about God are therefore meaningless — if you do not admit that there is no sort of evidence that could falsify your belief, then you might just as well believe anything you like.
- **if you are unable to falsify the claim you are making (e.g. 'God exists') and cannot say what would disprove it, the claim is unscientific and meaningless.**

Scientists do not repeatedly qualify their hypotheses. They establish the hypothesis and then test empirically whether it is true/false. They do not keep changing it to ensure that it is always proven correct.

In other words, their language is falsifiable, and therefore meaningful.

> [!example] For example:
> Take the statement '**God loves his children.**'
> 
> Flew refers to a case where a child is dying of inoperable throat cancer. The child's earthly father is driven frantic in his efforts to help, whereas their Heavenly Father appears indifferent and reveals no obvious signs of concern.
> 
> Rather than accepting this as evidence that the statement is false, the believer qualifies their statement by suggesting that 'God's love is not merely human love', or it is an 'inscrutable love.'
> 
> Flew asks: just what would have to happen for a believer to say — 'God does not love us' or that 'God does not exist.'
> 
> The fact is that there is nothing — because theists will continually qualify their statements instead — meaning that statements about God are meaningless nonsense.

| Falsification is in accordance with science — it restricts meaning to whatever we have scientific evidence for, which reflects the emphasis on empiricism ('epistemic imperialism') in c21st life.                                                                                                                       | The falsification principle cannot be falsified. It isn't meaningful because it fails it's own criteria.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Falsification captures how science is done better than Verification. This is because scientists don't only look for proof of a theory, they try to disprove it, too.                                                                                                                                                     | Religious belief is falsifiable: St. Paul said that 'if Christ has not been raised, your faith is pointless.' This suggests that Flew is incorrect to think that religious language is always unfalsifiable.                                                                                |
| Falsification is a perfect test of whether a person's belief is about reality or not. <br>If someone seems like they are holding onto a belief without any reason, you can ask what it could take for them to change their mind.

### Responses
#### 'Bliks' — R.M. Hare
> [!definition] Blik
> A framework of interpretation / a lens through which you see the world — i.e. a worldview. It is logically prior to the facts — you start out with a blik and your blik tells you how to interpret the world: what counts as a fact and what those facts mean.
> 
> It is a way of seeing things: a framework for interpreting the world, at it is non-cognitive.

##### Parable of the lunatic
> [!example] Hare's parable of the lunatic
> A certain lunatic is convinced that all dons (Oxford university lecturers) want to murder him. His friends introduce him to all the mildest and most respectable dons that they can find and say 'you see, he doesn't really want to murder you: he spoke to you in a cordial manner, surely you are convinced now?'
> 
> But the lunatic replies 'yes, but that was only his diabolical cunning; he's really plotting against me the whole time, like the rest of them; I know it I tell you.'
> 
> However many kindly dons are introduced to the lunatic, his reaction is the same.

- there are many different kinds of blik.
	- the lunatic's blik is an insane blik
	- alternatively, most people have sane bliks
- religious belief is a blik
	- religious beliefs are not statements to be verified: they are bliks
- **A religious blik is a common and powerful view, and if I have one and if I am sincere in believing it, then no amount of persuasion from well-meaning philosophers (such as Flew) will make me think differently.**
- **Belief precedes observation — it is deeply rooted & deeply held. It then provides the lens through which we interpret the world.**

## Hare v. Flew


| Flew — meaningless                                                                                                                                                                                    | Hare — meaningful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Religious statements are assertions about the world, so they are intended to be cognitive (i.e. factual.)                                                                                             | Religious statements are bliks. A blik is not a cognitive/factual assertion — it is an interpretation of the world. Religious bliks are therefore non-cognitive and non-factual.                                                                                                                                    |
| Religious believers allow nothing to count against their cognitive assertions, so religious statements are non-falsifiable and therefore meaningless. They die the death of a thousand qualifications | Religious bliks are non-falsifiable but this is because they are non-cognitive. Nevertheless, there are still deeply meaningful.<br><br>The lunatic may have an insane blik, but his refusal to think differently about the Oxford dons shows the depth of that meaning. the belief has deep significance for them. |
### Flew's response to Hare:
> [!quote] "If Hare's religion really is a blik, involving no cosmological assertions about the nature and activities of a supposed personal creator, then surely he is not a Christian at all?"

Flew rejected Hare's view that religious statements are non-cognitive bliks, because believers DO see their statements about God as cognitive.

## Other responses
### Basil Mitchell and faith
> [!example] Parable of the secret commander
> A partisan meets a strander who persuades him he is the secret commander of the resistance.
> 
> The partisan sometimes sees the stranger helping the resistance, and sometimes sees him handing over the resistance.
> 
> When challenged, the partisan says "the stranger knows best."

- Mitchell partly accepts Flew's point — there is evidence that counts for and against belief in God.
- Mitchell's point is the believers acknowledgement of evidence against their belief does not count as against their belief because they are committed by faith to trust in God, "significant article of faith."
Mitchell recognises the role of evidence in a way that Hare does not. He rejects Hare's claim that religious beliefs are bliks — based on reasoning. He supports Flew's claim that religious statements are assertions, but unlike Flew, sees a genuine role for faith.
