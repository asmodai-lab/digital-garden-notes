## The context
### Hegel
![Pasted image 20260120123132.png](/img/user/05%20-%20Images/1.2/Pasted%20image%2020260120123132.png)
Hegel is a German philosopher who is incredibly fucking important to philosophy. His ideas have dominated European philosophy since he was there.
- he argued that<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> all reality is one</span>: a universe in which everything ultimately forms <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">part of a spiritual reality</span> — the Absolute
- he emphasises the idea of progress and believes that the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> universe is in a continual state of improvement</span> (aka the Hegelian Dialect — see below.)
![synthesis.png](/img/user/05%20-%20Images/synthesis.png)
#### The reaction to Hegel
WW1 made people deeply question the Hegelian Dialect idea: clearly we weren't improving, we just unlocked <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">a whole new level of human suffering!</span>

##### Logical positivism
Originated in the work of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Vienna Circle</span> — a group of philosophers with mathematical and scientific background who met in Vienna in the 1920s and 1930s. Followed the thinking of Auguste Comte.

Their aim was to look at how we use language as a means of conveying knowledge.

## Ayer and the verification principle
> [!example] Their first principle is that talk of 'God' is meaningless

**Fundamental principle:** only those propositions that can be verified empirically have meaning.
> [!quote] 'The meaning of a proposition is the method of verification'
- since all knowledge about the world is based on experience, this should also determine what counts as meaningful
- the true task of philosophy is to<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> clarify whether propositions are meaningful</span>
	- i.e. is they make sense
- it is **not** to determine <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">whether a proposition is true or false.</span>

### Definitions
#### Analytic propositions
> true by definition or tautology
> > Tautologies are circular arguments and give us no new info, so are non cognitive.
> > 
> > e.g. 'bachelors are unmarried men' 'a straight line is the shortest distance between two points', etc.

These are necessarily true: to deny the propositions within the statements would be a contradiction. This is because these are **a priori.**

#### Synthetic propositions
> proved true by sense experience — i.e. empirical statements.
> > 'my coat is wet' (proved true/false by toughing the coat)
> > 
> > or scientific testing

The statement:
> "Elephants are pink and have green toenails."

is meaningful, although untrue: because it can be tested by observation. In contrast, the statement:
> "All wicked people will come to a bad end."

Is not meaningful, because it is impossible to test. This is because they are **a posteriori.**

> [!summary] This is the verification principle
> We know the meaning of a statement if we know the conditions under which the statement is true or false. If it is impossible to know how to prove the statement true or false, it is illogical — so therefore meaningless.

### Summary of his beliefs
Ayer is a key figure of the logical positivist movement, and the creator of the **verification principle.** The principle means that a statement is only meaningful if it is either:
1. **an analytic truth**: things such as mathematical statements and things that are true by definition (a bachelor is an unmarried man).
2. **verifiable** (*aka synthetic truth*): there is some observation or test (at least, in principle) that would prove the statement true. For example, even if the technology didn't exist yet, you could *in principle* meaningfully say: "there is water on Mars," because you could send a spaceship to find out.

> Ayer distinguishes between verification in theory and in practice.
> > Even if something could not be verified in practice, i.e.
> > 	"all metals heat when expanded."
> > 	 Or, "all leopards have spots,"
> > These are still meaningful because they are verifiable **in principle**, although not in practice: as we lack the ability to see every piece of metal being heated or to see all leopards.
> 

## Strong and Weak verification 
### Strong verification
> there is no doubt that a statement is true because one can verify it using sense experience or observation
> > "Mary has red hair," could be proved true or false by visiting Mary.

However, this form of verification would exclude many things — like "all human beings are mortal," — which is impossible to demonstrate via strong verification without killing everyone who lives now and will every live.
- even so, few would doubt that statement, right?
	- there's a reason why it's the 'theory of gravity' and the 'theory of evolution' — because, technically, there could be an experiment one day that disproves it.

### Weak verification
> statements that can be verified by observation and evidence obtained **at the time,** which can then be relied on by others.
> > e.g. Columbus discovered America, which was accepted as true because people confirmed it at the time.
> Any proposition that experience suggested was **probably true.**

#### Later modifications
Ayer later modified his definition of the verification principle and rejected strong verification, as he reasoned that:
>[!quote] "no statement could meet the criteria of the strong verification principle."

Because we can never conclusively make a statement about the world, **because our senses can be mistaken,** even about what we think is in front of us.
> I may be mistaken about whether my cat is in front of me as a I really see her; but I cannot get outside my mind to check whether my perception agrees with the facts. 
> >Because of my weakness in eyesight, I might mistake my neighbour's cat for my own.

Strong verification means that historical and scientific conclusions would be unverifiable. 

In fact, every factual statement would be meaningless, because nothing could be conclusively true.
- whereas anything can be supported using the weak verification principle.

##### Direct and indirect verification
**Direct**: statements that you can observe and therefore verify.
> "the sky is blue."

**Indirect**: statements which can be verified if there is no other directly verifiable evidence to support it.
> "there are black holes in space," can't be directly observed, but other evidence suggests their existence.

## Why is talk of God meaningless?

> [!question] Questions
> 1. Why might Logical Positivists argue that 'God exists' is *not* a tautology?
> 2. Why is the statement 'God hears me,' meaningless?
> 3. Is any statement regarding God factually meaningless, because God is referred to as a metaphysical being who is ineffable & transcendent?

Statements about God are meaningless (*according to Ayer*) because there is no method for their verification — they don't tell us anything about the world that is verifiable.

It's not possible to know the conditions under which propositions about God can be proved true or false: so such talk must be meaningless.

The proposition 'there is a god' is:
1. not analytic — can't be verified by the internal logic of the statement
2. not synthetic — can't be verified by external empirical evidence
C₁: talk of 'God' is meaningless. Just because the word 'God' exists, does not mean that there is a corresponding reality.

### The implications of the principle on religious language
As far as Ayer is concerned, both theists and atheists are talking nonsense.
- sense is not a given by adding a negative
Agnosticism also makes no sense because there are asking the question: "is there a God?" which is meaningless

Religious faith is nonsense, religious experience is nonsense. All discussion on the issue is nonsense, to Ayer.
> Dawkins treats religious belief as failed scientific hypotheses, devoid of proof. Ayer wouldn't even waste his time trying to disprove faith in the first place.

## Narrow view of meaning
### Assumes only science can tell us about the world
Art and poetry reveal valuable things about human nature, but are neither cognitive or scientifically verifiable. Logical positivism, by reducing all significant language to two categories, leaves no place for non verifiable contributions to human knowledge.

### Religious sentences are not in the same category as scientific sentences
To reduce sentences to two classes — meaningful and meaningless — misrepresents the fulness of either the: range of possible sentences, or of meaning.

### 'Toys in the Cupboard' (Swinburne)
In 'Coherence of Theism', Swinburne argues against logical positivism by claiming that there are sentences that obviously have meaning, but are not verifiable in any way, e.g. toys coming out of the cupboard at night and dancing around -> religious and ethical claims are still of meaning and importance even if they cannot be verified.

> [!warning] Is Swinburne misinterpreting Ayer?
> Ayer does not deny the emotional value of religious statements; what he denies is their verifiability.
> > Although whether verifiability -> meaning/significance... debatably, no.
> We cannot go from: Swinburne's assumption that a statement about toys in a cupboard -> assuming that any statement about God is meaningful in the same way.
> > In Swinburne's sentence, all words are understood through empirical experience, but a sentence about God involves words with **cannot be checked through sense experience**.
> > > These words rely on faith.

### Brummer
**To dismiss the very possibility of God seems to necessitate a particular world-view.** 
- to suggest things are only significant **if** open to scientific investigation is based on it's own metaphysical viewpoint: that the reality of the world is merely based on science.

## Science v Theology
### Emmet
**Theological statements are not as straightforward as scientific ones.** Error of Enlightenment thought to treat natural theology and it's claim univocally — that is, as scientific propositions which are equivalent to those of conventional science. 

Logical positivisms want to look for complete explanations provided by science, when meaning can also come from w=faith, which is not something that can be verified/falsified.

## Fails it's own test
The claim that statements are only meaningful is verifiable is, in itself, an unverifiable claim: it cannot be verified by sense experience. So, ironically, it is self-disproving.

---
Since we can't test the verification principle via sense experience, it isn't synthetic.

If it is analytical, then the problem is that logical positivists have given a new meaning to the word 'meaningful'.

### Practicality problems
- scientifically, not all claims will be verifiable. 
	- like with the existence of black holes
- historical statements are completely non-verifiable. 
	- we can read an account from someone, but that only means that we can decide that the writings are meaningful, not what they are actually describing
- how can we meaningfully describe our thoughts?
	- what about 'I had a weird dream last night' or 'I'm not looking forward to my exams'
- what about poetry, art, music, literature, etc
	- they can describe aspects of human experience, and open up new ways of seeing the world. But, they aren't verifiable.
- even economics, political science, and actual science can fall short of the verification principle.
*Judgements and hypotheses are not proven in the way needed with the principle, but still have meaning.*

### Ayer and Popper's response
**Ayer** responded by claiming that verificationism was a theory, not a statement, so did not need to pass the test.

**Karl Popper** argued that we cannot scientifically verify everything — it's an illogical test of meaning.

## Eschatologically verifiable

### The Celestial city
> [!info] The story of the celestial city
> Two men are travelling together along a road. One of them believes that it leads to the Celestial City, and the other believes that it leads nowhere. But, since this is the only road there is, both must travel it. Neither have been this way before, therefore neither is able to say what they will find around each corner.
> 
> During their journey, they meet with moments of refreshment and delight, and with hardship and danger. All the time, one of them thinks that this journey is a pilgrimage to the Celestial City, and the other sees this journey as an unavoidable and aimless ramble. Yet, when they turn the last corner, it will be apparent that one of them has been right the whole time, and the other wrong.

So, how can this story help to answer the problem of whether religious language can have any meaning, when considered in the light of logical positivism?

#### Hick's claim
Hick tried to suggest that it is possible to verify religious language **after death**, using the Celestial City as an example of this.
- of course, this is difficult to test with our human senses — as the verification principle demands — since we will be different 'beings' after death.
- however, Hick;s point does raise the issue of whether **future statements can be meaningful.**
