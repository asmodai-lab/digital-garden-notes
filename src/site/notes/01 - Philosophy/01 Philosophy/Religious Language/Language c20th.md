| Verification                | to prove an assertion true                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Meaningful                  | makes sense                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Univocal language           | unambiguous                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Equivocal language          | ambiguous — more than one meaning/interpretation                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Tautology                   | something that is the case and cannot be empirically found true/false — all bachelors are unmarried men.                                                                                                                  |
| Cognitive                   | propositions based on knowledge, and can be proven true or false through this.                                                                                                                                            |
| Non-cognitive               | propositions that cannot be proved true or false through knowledge — like ethical positions, or emotions.                                                                                                                 |
| Logical positivism          | The philosophical approach taken by the Vienna Circle. The logical positivist position is that theological language is literally meaningless, because it is neither a matter of logic nor provable by empirical evidence. |
| Verification principle      | Statements are only meaningful if they are true by definition (a tautology) or empirically verifiable. There are strong and weak forms.                                                                                   |
| Eschatological verification | Hick's view that the 'facts' of Christianity will be proved true or false at death.                                                                                                                                       |
| Blik                        | Hare's idea of a framework of interpretation/ a worldview — which is non-cognitive and non-falsifiable.                                                                                                                   |
| Falsificaiton principle     | Statements are factually significant if and only if their is some form of evidence which could, in theory, falsify it.                                                                                                    |

| **For**     | Ayer dismisses as 'meaningless' because it does not meet the criteria for verification.<br><br>Religious discussion is therefore 'meaningless' — result is that religion is not taken seriously as a worldview. | It is dismissed as 'meaningless' because religious believers will not falsify their beliefs, instead they move the goalposts (i.e. 'qualify').<br><br>This leads to 'death of God by a thousand qualifications' (Flew) | Religious language is meaningful for those who belong to a religious form of life and 'play' a religious language game.<br><br>The meaningfulness of language must be understood in context. |
| **Against** | Hick's Eschatological verification seeks to show that religious language can be verified.                                                                                                                       | Hare's bliks show that religious language is deeply meaningful for those who have a religious blik.                                                                                                                    | However, this leads to religious anti-realism, and suggests that religious statements only have meaning for those who use them, but they're more than that.                                  |
