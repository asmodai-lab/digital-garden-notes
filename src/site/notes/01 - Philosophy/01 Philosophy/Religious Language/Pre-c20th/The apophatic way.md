### Via Negativa / the apophatic way

##### Important note on the cataphatic way
First — how do you remember which 'phatic' is which?
- using a joke from chemistry!
	- **Cat**ions are **paw**sitive — i.e. the **cat**aphatic way is via **positiva**.

Second — the cataphatic way is a discredited way of talking about God. Almost nobody is in favour of it, and those who are (Aquinas) came up with a *lot* more to justify it. The whole 'problem of religious language' is saying that the cataphatic way is completely insufficient.

Anyway. Continuing on.
#### What is the apophatic way?
- literally means the 'negative way' because God can only be described in terms of what God is not.
		- apophatic comes from the Greek word 'apophasis'- which means 'negation.'
	- It argues that God is transcendent so you cannot say what God is.
- However you can clearly say what God is not; 
	- God is not a human being because God is transcendent, so God cannot have a body.
- Equally, when Christians say 'God is good' they may not know exactly what they mean, when they use the word 'good'
	- but they know for sure that God is *not* evil.
> The proponents argue that speaking about God in negative terms avoids the problem of misrepresenting God.

#### Supporting Scholars
##### Pseudo-Dionysus
(or as I like to call him, Fake Dionysus. But don't call him that in essays, Pseudo Dionysus is **literally** what he is called.)

The apophatic way was developed by the early church writer Pseudo Dionysius, or Dionysius the Aeropagite.
- *His writings originated much later than the time of the apostles- because he is not the Dionysus of the Acts of the Apostles. This is why he is called 'pseudo'*
>Influenced by Plato, he argued that the soul's search for God was held back by the demands of the body and the mind's desire for understanding.
>-> stop trying to use logic and arguments! Allow God to speak in the stillness- accepting God will remain a mystery.

Pseudo-Dionysus argued that because God is completely beyond our understanding, we cannot talk about what God *is*.
- God is beyond assertion, beyond language.

By negation, Dionysus did not mean 'privation.'
- i.e. saying 'God is not living' is **not** the same as saying that 'God is lifeless'
	- we are accepting that God is beyond human distinctions (such as being alive **or** being dead)

He argues that trying to understand God is not just pointless, but counterproductive: because it separates us from God. 
- Dionysus uses the example of Moses' ascending of Mount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments. 
	- He describes Moses as plunging into the 'darkness of unknowing ... renouncing all that the mind may conceive.'

>[!QUOTE]
>_“as we plunge into darkness which is beyond intellect, we shall find ourselves not simply running short of words but actually speechless and unknowing. The more we climb, the more language falters, and when we have moved to the top of our ascent, language will turn silent completely, since we will be near to One which is indescribable”_

Accepting the apophatic way means that one breaks free from grasping for knowledge of God. This causes an "inactivity of all knowledge" which leads one to be "supremely united to the completely unknown."
- it is not really 'knowledge' in that the mind understands God, it is 'unity' with God.
	- what Pseudo-Dionysus meant by 'unity' is up for debate, although it's clearly some way of becoming closer to God.
> This is very reminiscent of ideas about the Fall and losing unity with God.
- The very reason that the Fall occurred was because of their (Adam & Eve's) desire for knowledge (eating the apple)

To clarify, it seems that Pseudo-Dionysus thinks that the apophatic way is the only way one can speak truthfully about God, but also that speaking about God is a useless endeavour, because God is so above human comprehension. 
> Yes, his ideas make no sense next to each other. What was this guy on?

###### Maimoni-deez nuts
Maimonides supports the apophatic way with his example of the ship.
>[!EXAMPLE] Example of the ship
> Imagine someone who knows that something called a 'ship' exists, but doesn't know what that means. Maimonides runs through ten examples of use of negative language — that the ship is not e.g. a sphere, flat object, property, plant, mineral, etc
> >[!QUOTE] His explanations for this:
> >1. _“It is clear that this tenth person has almost arrived at the correct notion of a ‘ship’ by the foregoing negative attributes”_
> >2. _“you will come nearer to the knowledge and comprehension of God by the negative attributes”_

Note that Maimonides **does not** argue that one can fully know God in this way — he explicitly argues against this. He merely argues that, via apophatic language, one can *come nearer* to knowledge of God. 
- if you remember maths GCSE (god forbid), think of it like an exponential curve: forever getting closer to a certain axis, but never reaching it, until infinity.

> I think that this analogy would be much stronger if it was that the object was something that cannot be understood without experiencing it — like certain tastes (sweet, spicy, fizzy, 'umami'). 
> > Or, a similar example, making a definition of a word that includes itself; i.e. extremely unhelpful.

#### Arguments on the apophatic way
##### Brian Davies on Maimonides
Brian Davies points out that negative language only allows us to actually gain knowledge in 'special cases', such as when we know all the possibilities for xyz. 
- for example, if we know that someone isn't left-handed OR ambidextrous, we know that they must be right-handed.
However, most cases aren't like that.
>[!example]
>_“Suppose I say that there is something in my room, and suppose I reject every suggestion you make as to what is actually there. In that case, you will get no idea at all about what is in my room. And, going back to the above quotation from Maimonides, it is simply wrong to say that someone who has all the negations mentioned in it ‘has almost arrived at the correct notion of a “ship” ‘. Such a person could equally well be thinking of a wardrobe or a coffin.”_

The conclusion Davies draws is that negative language does not grant us any knowledge of God.

You could, however, simply discount Maimonides' example when arguing for the apophatic way — it isn't foundational to the apophatic way in any sense. In fact, the apophatic way from Pseudo-Dionysus argues that knowing God at all is nonsensical.

On the other hand, you can argue that the ship example fails because you can only describe a ship (to the observer) if you know what a ship is. We *don't* know what God is.

##### Aquinas's criticisms
Via negativa intrinsically stops the anthropomorphizing of God, by detaching 'Him' from human terms and imagination, thereby allowing 'His' transcendence to be widely understood.
- On the flip side, detaching God from humanity makes God impersonal, or non-interactive with humanity.

Aquinas claims that negative language is *'not what people want to say when they talk about God'*. I.e. in human terms;

>[!EXAMPLE] Examples
>"God is love"
>"God is spirit"
>"I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God" - Exodus

Aquinas is saying that **we already know** that the human terms that we use do not fully encapsulate God, but that we can use that as a base understanding, i.e.:
> Human terminology (love, etc) + the understanding that God is infinite = satisfactory language about God

Pseudo-Dionysus would argue against this through his concept of 'unity,' which can only be gained once we give up attempting to understand God through reason. Our ration is false and distracting us from having a spiritual relationship with God.
- Furthermore, the average Christian is unlikely to think of their religious language as analogical. Even if we agree that Aquinas successfully defended the cataphatic way, his theory doesn't actually have an impact in people's lives. 
	- Or, you could argue that Aquinas' theories are accepted — because the average Christian (in this argument) understands that God is infinitely greater than their language ascribed to him.

##### Miscellaneous critiques
Maimonides argued that seemingly cataphatic descriptions of God in the Bible should be interpreted as referring to God’s immanence, such as God’s actions in the world.

Via Negativa is thus often defended by distinguishing between:

- God’s transcendence: God’s actual but unknowable being which can only be described negatively.
- God’s immanence: God’s actions in the physical world which can be described positively, since God’s unknowable being/nature is not being described. This is what all biblical language about God is argued to refer to

There are other descriptions of God as having a ‘face’ or ‘walking’ in the garden of Eden. These can be dismissed as metaphorical language, or perhaps just referring to God’s immanent actions.
>However, there are Bible passages which seem to describe God’s nature itself that seem difficult for Maimonides’ argument to explain.
>>In the Gospel of John God is described positively: “God is love” and “God is spirit”. God even himself describes himself in positive terms: ”I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God.” (Exodus 20:5).
