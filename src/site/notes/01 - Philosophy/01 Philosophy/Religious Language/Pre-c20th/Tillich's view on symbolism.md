Tillich has a belief of all time. And my God, it really is a belief of all time.

## Tillich's symbolism

Tillich believes that all religious language is, is symbols. Now, what the fuck does he mean by this?

>[!TIP] What the fuck does he mean by this?
> Tillich first uses a flag to illustrate his point. A flag points to a certain country, **and** it is also part of that country — in it's identity and history etc.
> > so, symbols are something that both **point to** and **participate in** a thing.
> 
> He also then points to the cross. The cross is both a symbol for something in Christianity (the death and resurrection of Christ) and participates in it.


### God (the being, not the exclamation)

Tillich has no time for arguments about whether or not God exists. He argues that to argue whether God exists is to posit that He doesn't.
> This is because God is 'the ground of all being', i.e. 'being' in itself. 
> > 'God' is just a symbol for being itself, not an actual being.
> 
> Consider what happens when a Christian looks at a crucifix. It means something to them. A crucifix is not a word, but it still inspires meaning in the mind of a person who sees it. Tillich thinks religious language functions like that. When a person hears religious language, e.g. “God be with you”, the effect on their mind is just like the effect of seeing a crucifix. The meaning they feel is a result of the words functioning symbolically.

God does not exist, He is beyond essence and existence. To argue that God exists is to deny Him.

#### What do it do

The function of religious symbols is to spiritually connect people to the religious dimension of reality. So, the meaning of religious language is the spiritual connection to God it inspires through symbolic participation in the being of God.

Tillich proposes four main principles of his **theory of participation**:

1. pointing to something beyond itself
2. Participating in what it points to (*The crucifix is part of Christianity, it doesn’t just point to it. Religious language participates in the being of God, or in being-itself.*)
3. Reveals a deeper meaning of reality/spiritual levels of reality
4. Opens up dimensions of the soul that correspond to those levels of reality

So symbolic language is like poetry or art — offering a new view or meaning of life, but hard to explain to those who haven't experienced it.

### Differences between Tillich and Analogy & Via Negativa

The main strength of symbolism is that is side-steps the issue of our human inability to understand God, because it suggests that symbolism points to God, participates in God, and opens up spiritual levels of reality.
> Essentially, religious language is a kind of religious experience, which connects souls to God without needing to understand God.

### My thoughts

This makes absolutely zero sense and has zero use. This is gobbledygook. Haberdashery. Bullshit.

What is the point of language if not to convey some sort of objective meaning, not subject to our own experiences? This is literally just (American weed smoker voice) 'you gotta just *know* dude'. It's pointless! There is no fucking point!

## Criticisms of Symbolism

| Tillich seems more successful in his approach in that he captures how everyday religious language actually functions. When Christians look at a crucifix, they can have deep spiritual feelings, and this is often the most important thing for an individual. Tillich's theory succeeds because it focuses more on the feelings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Alston argues that certain doctrines (like heaven & hell) have to be taken as factual. He claims that 'there is no point trying to determine whether the statement is true or false.' Religion is concerned with objective things, so religious language cant just be symbolic. Hick also points out that philosophical language about God (like 'necessary') is not symbolic.<br>When Christians think using religious language, they express beliefs about God which can be true or false. Cognitivism is a key element of religious meaning, which Tillich does not account for. |
| Religion is primarily a human impulse towards something higher than the limits of science or reason. Religion is primarily about our 'ultimate concern' (what does it mean to live a finite human life in the context of the universe) : which isn't historical, scientific or factual. Therefore, Tillich is right to refocus religious language towards spirituality. It is about surrendering to our need for spiritual fulfilment. Religious language doesn't need to be literal or factual to be spiritually fulfilling, it only needs to participate in being-itself and so bridge our souls to being-itself. | Tillich goes too far in reducing all religious language to symbols. It is only sometimes symbolic — factual belief in heaven & hell (etc) is just as important to Christian believers as the spiritual experience gained using symbolic language. Tillich fails to capture the cognitive approach to religious language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Tillich seems to solve the difficulty of meaningfully talking about a God that is beyond our understanding. Religious language functions as a sort of spiritual or religious experience which connects human souls to God. We don’t need to understand God to be connected to God. Religious language is meaningful insofar as it participates in being-itself, i.e, in God.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Hick argues that Tillich's flag example does not adequately explain participation. First, it isn't clear how a flag participates in the power and dignity of a nation. Second, it's not clear whether religious symbols are supposed to participate in the ground of being in the same way. Third, a traditional religious doctrine is that God and nature and connected. In some sense the world is already thought to participate in God. <br>So, it's not clear how symbols participate in the ground of being differently to everything else that already does.<br><br>Also, it's not clear how exactly symbols 'participate' in higher spiritual levels of reality.<br><br>Essentially, Hick's concern is that symbols and participation and connection to a higher reality are way too vague, which suggests subjectivity. Symbolic meaning could just be in our minds, and not connect us to anything higher.<br>- this is the problem with seperating religious meaning from factual meaning and instead connecting it to this vague idea of spiritual connection to the 'ground of being'.<br>- This ends up reducing God and religion to the *feelings in your heart bro.* |
| This objection is unsuccessful because Tillich doesn’t think his theory makes religious language completely subjective, because it is connected to the objective. He says:<br><br>_“The term ‘ultimate concern’ united the subjective and the objective side of the act of faith.” –_ Tillich.<br><br>_“In terms like ultimate, unconditional, infinite, absolute, the difference between subjectivity and objectivity is overcome. The ultimate of the act of faith and the ultimate that is meant in the act of faith are one and the same.”_ – Tillich.<br><br>Tillich seems to be saying that the faith is directed towards something objective, such as God or the ground or being. When we use symbolic religious terms, we express our personal subjective faith. Yet, we thereby also make an objective act of faith through our souls connecting to spiritual levels of reality. | This critique of Tillich is successful. Spiritual experiences where a person loses their sense of subjective self are possible, but they are still just happening inside subjective experience. Tillich’s theory can be criticised like religious experiences – as purely subjective.<br><br>Personal subjective experience cannot be a basis for the shared intersubjective meaning in religious language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
### Randall! Help!
Randall has a different symbolic theory.

Essentially, symbols are completely subjective and don't link to a 'higher reality', unlike Tillich. So, it's completely non-cognitive.

**Randall’s theory is more successful than Tillich’s** because Randall accepts that symbols are completely subjective and that symbolic language is non-cognitive.

Randall views symbols as completely subjective in our mind and thus non-cognitive. Tillich is stuck with the perhaps impossible difficulty of explaining how he could possibly know that symbolic language has the spiritual power he thinks it does. Arguably by accepting that symbols are completely subjective and don’t have some mysterious power extending beyond our subjective minds, Randall’s theory is more successful while still retaining the strengths of Tillich’s, that it accurately captures most religious meaning in the lives and experiences of Christians.

Randall makes an analogy between the power of music, art and poetry to affect us, arguing that religious language functions similarly.

For Randall, symbols should not be understood as symbolising some external thing, they should be understood by what they do; by their “function”. Randall argues that symbols do four things:

1. Arouse emotions and motivate action
2. Stimulate cooperative action, bind community together
3. Communicate aspects of experience that cannot be expressed with literal language.
4. Evoke, foster and clarify human experience of the divine.

**non-cognitivism is non-traditional.** However, Randall is then left with the issue that non-cognitive religious language cannot express factual objective true statements. Traditional theologians would not accept that fundamental starting point however, they would argue that religion actually is about much more than human experience, it is about reality and therefore religious language must be cognitive.

**Non-traditional doesn’t mean wrong!** Randall and Tillich are part of a protestant movement in theology which was influenced by Schleiermacher to think that religion is primarily about human experience, whereas doctrines, dogmas and beliefs are secondary in importance.

Theologians who followed this view then became attracted to existentialism. Randall and Tillich are both influenced by existentialism.

*Tillich thinks religious meaning is not purely subjective, whereas Randall thinks it is.*

You could conclude that it is the religious meaning of and in human experience that is most important for a theory of religious language to capture.
