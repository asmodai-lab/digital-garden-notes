## Intro

This note is mostly on the teleological argument, although I've embedded the cosmological argument note at the end for the sake of easy access. I initially had the two together, but it was just too long. 

You do need to know how to separate the teleological and cosmological arguments. Here's my method down below:

> Note to self, perhaps separate the arguments and the comparison to a separate note? Later task

### Differentiating the two
There is, however, an easy way to tell them apart. You just have to remember it!

| Teleological                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Cosmological                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

If this is still a headache to remember, don't worry! Nobody is sure what is which and who is who. The specifics of which argument goes where is horrible and everyone is unsure. If you get it a tad wrong, don't worry — everyone else will.

## Teleological argument

There is so much ... **stuff** with this argument. People are constantly responding specifically to other people and oh my god it makes my head hurt. Everyone is always responding to everyone. At the end, I'll (hopefully, but no promises) do a big ol' mind-map to define the lines of argument.

Anyway. 

### Proponents

#### Arguments about order *within* nature
##### Aquinas' (secret) 5th way
It's not a secret, I just like making memes. Anyway
>[!quote] *Summa Theologica*
> “The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. We see that things which lack intelligence, such as natural bodies, act for an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in the same way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that not fortuitously, but designedly, do they achieve their end. Now whatever lacks intelligence cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence; as the arrow is shot to its mark by the archer. Therefore some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call God.”
> > [!summary] TLDR;
> > Aquinas is arguing that natural objects act in consistent, goal directed ways — even without consciousness or intelligence. (Like plants growing towards the sun)
> > 
> > Such regular purposeful behaviour cannot just be chance. Aquinas argues that there must be an intelligence guiding these things to their goals
> > > In the same way that an archer guides an arrow to a target

> > These non-intelligent things require an external intelligence to direct them. Aquinas concludes that this is God

Here's the response to that:

##### The scientific revolution
Aquinas' 5th way is based on the scientific norm of the day — which was shaped by Aristotle.

> > for example, a seed grows into a plant because it's *telos* is to fully develop and reproduce.

But following the scientific revolution of the 16th Century, this norm got replaced. Rather than explaining phenomena in terms of telos — i.e. an inherent goal, purpose, or intention — this new (Newtonian) approach described phenomena through impersonal, mechanistic laws. 

###### Aristotelian versus Newtonian

| Aristotelian explanation                                                                                     | Mechanistic/Newtonian explanation                                                                                                                      |

| A seed grows into a plant because that is it's purpose/telos.                                                | A seed grows into a plant because of genetic instructions interacting/being fuelled by environmental factors<br>> like water, photosynthesis, minerals |
| A rock falls to the ground because it's natural place is at the centre of the Earth — so that is it's telos. | A rock falls to the ground because of gravity.                                                                                                         |
###### A possible re-rebuttal
Not everything can be explained scientifically via the Newtonian method. For example, [[01 - Philosophy/01 Philosophy/Teleological#Swinburne's version\|Swinburne's teleological argument]] argues that science works by *assuming* scientific laws to explain things, but that the scientific explanations do not explain *why the laws themselves exist.*

##### Hume's argument from analogy
This is incredibly similar [[01 - Philosophy/01 Philosophy/Religious Language/Aquinas' analogies#Analogy of attribution\|Aquinas' analogy of attribution]], if you are familiar. 
- this is also what I'd call the quintessential design argument. Many of the others come from here. Don't bother learning their specifics if you don't have the time, just this one. 

>[!quote] From *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion*
> "Look round the world: Contemplate the whole and every part of it: You will find it to be nothing but one great machine, subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions, to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and explain. All these various machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an accuracy, which ravishes into admiration all men, who have ever contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance; of human design, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the Author of nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work, which he has executed. By this argument a posteriori, and by this argument alone, do we prove at once the existence of a Deity, and his similarity to human mind and intelligence.”
>>[!summary] TLDR:
>> Essentially, Hume is arguing that because two things are similar in some ways, then it's reasonable to think that they might be similar in other ways, too.
>> > For example, if your friend likes the same art and music, then *by analogy*, it's reasonable to expect that they'll like the same movies as you also.

This is what Hume is arguing. The universe is like a machine in that it's orderly, complex, full of different parts that serve specific functions, etc 
- like how the various parts of an eye are arranged in a manner to achieve sight
- or that the orbit of the Earth around the sun is such that it can provide a stable environment for life (aka the 'goldilocks zone')
Since we know that these machines have designers who made them, then — by analogy — it's reasonable to assume that the universe also has a designer.

| Man-made machines                       | The universe                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Parts adjusted accurately to each other | Parts adjusted accurately to each other          |
| Adapting of means to ends               | Adapting of means to ends                        |
| Designed by an intelligence/mind        | *Probably also designed by an intelligence/mind* |
Also, as Hume's character says, given the sheer scope of this design — i.e. comparing the grandeur of the entire universe to simple machines — that this designer must be *"possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work."*

###### A* zone
Please note that, throughout this, Hume is arguing that, using this: *it is reasonable to believe that God exists*, he is **not arguing that God definitely exists.**
- like in a court case; where one often does not have to prove whether the defendant did or did not commit an act with absolute certainty, but only **beyond reasonable doubt** — mostly because proving anything with absolute certainty is almost always impossible — especially in court cases — and partly because if one cannot reasonably believe that someone committed a crime, one also cannot reasonably believe that they deserve punishment, and vice versa.
	- although please note that the boundary for 'reasonable doubt' changes per court case. If the punishment is higher, the bounds of 'reasonable doubt' must also be higher. 
		- this is because it would be significantly more unjust to give an innocent a very large penalty compared to a smaller penalty, especially when it is unsure whether they were innocent. Most people can live through smaller fines or short prison sentences, not — say — the death penalty.
			-  i.e: give an innocent man a £100 fine for speeding. Okay yeah, that does suck and is unjust, but perhaps he was driving the exact same car as a car that was speeding, and the cop got confused. Without the knowledge that these two had the same car, it is reasonable to believe that : given you know a certain car was speeding, this man — who owns the same car and was driving it in the area at the time — was speeding.
			- versus — say you send an innocent man to receive the death penalty for being a serial killer. This man has similar enough features to the killer, and was in the area at the time of the killings without a strong alibi. Most of the witnesses identified him as the killer in a police lineup. There is no other evidence linking him to the killings: he has multiple character witnesses that he is a good man, and has no motive to kill these people. This is not beyond reasonable doubt for a murder trial, and sending him to get the death penalty is unjust.
	- one could argue that God is one such higher case, and so requires higher bounds of 'beyond reasonable doubt.' Whether you think Hume's argument does or doesn't fit the criteria (and how you will argue as such) is up to you.

And here's the problems! This time there are two!


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/01-philosophy/01-philosophy/teleological/#weaknesses-in-the-analogy" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



##### Weaknesses in the analogy
Hume's analogy was presented as a dialogue, so we don't even have to come up with some of the responses!

>[!quote] Hume's response to himself in *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion*
> “But wherever you depart, in the least, from the similarity of the cases, you diminish proportionably the evidence; and may at last bring it to a very weak analogy, which is confessedly liable to error and uncertainty. After having experienced the circulation of the blood in human creatures, we make no doubt that it takes place in Titius and Mævius: But from its circulation in frogs and fishes, it is only a presumption, though a strong one, from analogy, that it takes place in men and other animals. The analogical reasoning is much weaker, when we infer the circulation of the sap in vegetables from our experience that the blood circulates in animals; and those, who hastily followed that imperfect analogy, are found, by more accurate experiments, to have been mistaken.”
> > [!summary] TLDR
> > As Hume's character points out, arguments from analogy are only as strong as the similarity of the two things being compared.
> > > For example:
> > > - if one human has circulating blood, we are justified in claiming that all humans do.
> > > - furthermore, we are somewhat justified in generalising from circulation of blood in humans to frogs and fishes
> > > - however, when the analogy goes from animals to plants, it's much weaker: because the idea that plants circulate sap like how animals circulate blood is false.

If you want another example:
- a lion is similar to a cat because they are both fluffy mammals (and many other similarities — carnivorous, got claws, biological similarities, etc)
- since cats make good pets, one could 'reasonably argue' that a lion would also make a good pet.
	- i.e. just because two things are similar in some ways does not prove that they are similar in all ways. There can be many differences.
This is similar between machines and the universe:

| Man-made machines                      | The universe                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| We have seen them be designed by minds | we haven't seen the universe being designed by a mind |
| Not alive, mechanical                  | full of life, biological                              |
| has clear purpose                      | no clear purpose                                      |
So, while there are some similarities between man-made machines and the universe – like ‘fitting of means to ends’ – that _justify_ the inference to the further similarity of design, there are more differences that _weaken_ this inference:

- Firstly, Hume's character (Philo) notes that we have experience of human-made things being designed – like houses and watches – but no such experience of natural objects like eyes, hearts, or planets. What we _do_ observe are natural processes such as reproduction and growth, which suggest a cause of the universe more like “generation and vegetation” than conscious design.
- Secondly, the argument focuses only on the most ordered _parts_ of nature, such as the human eye, and ignores the vast stretches of disorder and emptiness in the universe. While _parts_ of the universe, like an eye, seem to have purpose and design like man-made items, when you look at the universe _as a whole_ the analogy is much weaker.

##### Spatial disorder and design flaws
Teleological arguments point to examples of *order* in nature, things that serve a purpose (like the eye -> sight), and use this as evidence for a designer.
- however, one can just as easily point to examples of disorder and design flaws in nature — which should count as evidence against a designer (or evidence for a designer which is shit at their job)

**How do we argue this?**
1. **look at the universe as a whole: order appears to be the exception, not the rule.** Most of the universe is empty space, uninhabitable planets, and random rocks and asteroids that don't serve an obvious purpose.
2. **we can also point to imperfections and design flaws on Earth**. The most obvious is the problem of evil — i.e. natural and moral evil: but also look at the human body. The appendix is useless and just explodes, our spine is so fragile for being incredibly important, the funny bone has no purpose, some people are born with chronic conditions or disabilities for no apparent reason, and I could go on. 
	1. Hume argues, through Philo, that it would be better design for humans to be motivated only by varying degrees of pleasure, rather than by avoiding pain.
>[!quote] Hume criticising himself in *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion*
> *“The first circumstance which introduces evil, is that contrivance or economy of the animal creation, by which pains, as well as pleasures, are employed to excite all creatures to action, and make them vigilant in the great work of self-preservation. Now pleasure alone, in its various degrees, seems to human understanding sufficient for this purpose. All animals might be constantly in a state of enjoyment: but when urged by any of the necessities of nature, such as thirst, hunger, weariness; instead of pain, they might feel a diminution of pleasure, by which they might be prompted to seek that object which is necessary to their subsistence. Men pursue pleasure as eagerly as they avoid pain; at least they might have been so constituted. It seems, therefore, plainly possible to carry on the business of life without any pain. Why then is any animal ever rendered susceptible of such a sensation? If animals can be free from it an hour, they might enjoy a perpetual exemption from it; and it required as particular a contrivance of their organs to produce that feeling, as to endow them with sight, hearing, or any of the senses.”*
> 
> Philo further points out seemingly simple improvements that the designer could have made — like making humans stronger/faster, or at least less lazy.
> 
> *“In order to cure most of the ills of human life, I require not that man should have the wings of the eagle, the swiftness of the stag, the force of the ox, the arms of the lion, the scales of the crocodile or rhinoceros; much less do I demand the sagacity of an angel or cherubim. I am contented to take an increase in one single power or faculty of his soul. Let him be endowed with a greater propensity to industry and labour; a more vigorous spring and activity of mind; a more constant bent to business and application. Let the whole species possess naturally an equal diligence with that which many individuals are able to attain by habit and reflection; and the most beneficial consequences, without any allay of ill, is the immediate and necessary result of this endowment. Almost all the moral, as well as natural evils of human life, arise from idleness; and were our species, by the original constitution of their frame, exempt from this vice or infirmity, the perfect cultivation of land, the improvement of arts and manufactures, the exact execution of every office and duty, immediately follow; and men at once may fully reach that state of society, which is so imperfectly attained by the best regulated government.”*
> 
> Philo further points out that things could be more finely tuned. Like how wind can power ships and windmills, but if too strong cause hurricanes. The systems of nature swing to extremes instead of staying within precise limits that you would expect from deliberate design.
> 
> *“But at the same time, it must be observed, that none of these parts or principles, however useful, are so accurately adjusted, as to keep precisely within those bounds in which their utility consists; but they are, all of them, apt, on every occasion, to run into the one extreme or the other. One would imagine, that this grand production had not received the last hand of the maker; so little finished is every part, and so coarse are the strokes with which it is executed. Thus, the winds are requisite to convey the vapours along the surface of the globe, and to assist men in navigation: but how oft, rising up to tempests and hurricanes, do they become pernicious? Rains are necessary to nourish all the plants and animals of the earth: but how often are they defective? how often excessive? Heat is requisite to all life and vegetation; but is not always found in the due proportion. On the mixture and secretion of the humours and juices of the body depend the health and prosperity of the animal: but the parts perform not regularly their proper function. What more useful than all the passions of the mind, ambition, vanity, love, anger? But how oft do they break their bounds, and cause the greatest convulsions in society? There is nothing so advantageous in the universe, but what frequently becomes pernicious, by its excess or defect; nor has Nature guarded, with the requisite accuracy, against all disorder or confusion. The irregularity is never perhaps so great as to destroy any species; but is often sufficient to involve the individuals in ruin and misery.”*

All of these many, many examples of flawed or purposeless design can be used as evidence against nature being deliberately designed.

###### A possible re-rebuttal
Not everything can be explained scientifically via the Newtonian method. For example, [[01 - Philosophy/01 Philosophy/Teleological#Swinburne's version\|Swinburne's teleological argument]] argues that science works by *assuming* scientific laws to explain things, but that the scientific explanations do not explain *why the laws themselves exist.*


##### Weaknesses in the analogy
Hume's analogy was presented as a dialogue, so we don't even have to come up with some of the responses!

>[!quote] Hume's response to himself in *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion*
> “But wherever you depart, in the least, from the similarity of the cases, you diminish proportionably the evidence; and may at last bring it to a very weak analogy, which is confessedly liable to error and uncertainty. After having experienced the circulation of the blood in human creatures, we make no doubt that it takes place in Titius and Mævius: But from its circulation in frogs and fishes, it is only a presumption, though a strong one, from analogy, that it takes place in men and other animals. The analogical reasoning is much weaker, when we infer the circulation of the sap in vegetables from our experience that the blood circulates in animals; and those, who hastily followed that imperfect analogy, are found, by more accurate experiments, to have been mistaken.”
> > [!summary] TLDR
> > As Hume's character points out, arguments from analogy are only as strong as the similarity of the two things being compared.
> > > For example:
> > > - if one human has circulating blood, we are justified in claiming that all humans do.
> > > - furthermore, we are somewhat justified in generalising from circulation of blood in humans to frogs and fishes
> > > - however, when the analogy goes from animals to plants, it's much weaker: because the idea that plants circulate sap like how animals circulate blood is false.

If you want another example:
- a lion is similar to a cat because they are both fluffy mammals (and many other similarities — carnivorous, got claws, biological similarities, etc)
- since cats make good pets, one could 'reasonably argue' that a lion would also make a good pet.
	- i.e. just because two things are similar in some ways does not prove that they are similar in all ways. There can be many differences.
This is similar between machines and the universe:

| Man-made machines                      | The universe                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| We have seen them be designed by minds | we haven't seen the universe being designed by a mind |
| Not alive, mechanical                  | full of life, biological                              |
| has clear purpose                      | no clear purpose                                      |
So, while there are some similarities between man-made machines and the universe – like ‘fitting of means to ends’ – that _justify_ the inference to the further similarity of design, there are more differences that _weaken_ this inference:

- Firstly, Hume's character (Philo) notes that we have experience of human-made things being designed – like houses and watches – but no such experience of natural objects like eyes, hearts, or planets. What we _do_ observe are natural processes such as reproduction and growth, which suggest a cause of the universe more like “generation and vegetation” than conscious design.
- Secondly, the argument focuses only on the most ordered _parts_ of nature, such as the human eye, and ignores the vast stretches of disorder and emptiness in the universe. While _parts_ of the universe, like an eye, seem to have purpose and design like man-made items, when you look at the universe _as a whole_ the analogy is much weaker.

##### Spatial disorder and design flaws
Teleological arguments point to examples of *order* in nature, things that serve a purpose (like the eye -> sight), and use this as evidence for a designer.
- however, one can just as easily point to examples of disorder and design flaws in nature — which should count as evidence against a designer (or evidence for a designer which is shit at their job)

**How do we argue this?**
1. **look at the universe as a whole: order appears to be the exception, not the rule.** Most of the universe is empty space, uninhabitable planets, and random rocks and asteroids that don't serve an obvious purpose.
2. **we can also point to imperfections and design flaws on Earth**. The most obvious is the problem of evil — i.e. natural and moral evil: but also look at the human body. The appendix is useless and just explodes, our spine is so fragile for being incredibly important, the funny bone has no purpose, some people are born with chronic conditions or disabilities for no apparent reason, and I could go on. 
	1. Hume argues, through Philo, that it would be better design for humans to be motivated only by varying degrees of pleasure, rather than by avoiding pain.
>[!quote] Hume criticising himself in *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion*
> *“The first circumstance which introduces evil, is that contrivance or economy of the animal creation, by which pains, as well as pleasures, are employed to excite all creatures to action, and make them vigilant in the great work of self-preservation. Now pleasure alone, in its various degrees, seems to human understanding sufficient for this purpose. All animals might be constantly in a state of enjoyment: but when urged by any of the necessities of nature, such as thirst, hunger, weariness; instead of pain, they might feel a diminution of pleasure, by which they might be prompted to seek that object which is necessary to their subsistence. Men pursue pleasure as eagerly as they avoid pain; at least they might have been so constituted. It seems, therefore, plainly possible to carry on the business of life without any pain. Why then is any animal ever rendered susceptible of such a sensation? If animals can be free from it an hour, they might enjoy a perpetual exemption from it; and it required as particular a contrivance of their organs to produce that feeling, as to endow them with sight, hearing, or any of the senses.”*
> 
> Philo further points out seemingly simple improvements that the designer could have made — like making humans stronger/faster, or at least less lazy.
> 
> *“In order to cure most of the ills of human life, I require not that man should have the wings of the eagle, the swiftness of the stag, the force of the ox, the arms of the lion, the scales of the crocodile or rhinoceros; much less do I demand the sagacity of an angel or cherubim. I am contented to take an increase in one single power or faculty of his soul. Let him be endowed with a greater propensity to industry and labour; a more vigorous spring and activity of mind; a more constant bent to business and application. Let the whole species possess naturally an equal diligence with that which many individuals are able to attain by habit and reflection; and the most beneficial consequences, without any allay of ill, is the immediate and necessary result of this endowment. Almost all the moral, as well as natural evils of human life, arise from idleness; and were our species, by the original constitution of their frame, exempt from this vice or infirmity, the perfect cultivation of land, the improvement of arts and manufactures, the exact execution of every office and duty, immediately follow; and men at once may fully reach that state of society, which is so imperfectly attained by the best regulated government.”*
> 
> Philo further points out that things could be more finely tuned. Like how wind can power ships and windmills, but if too strong cause hurricanes. The systems of nature swing to extremes instead of staying within precise limits that you would expect from deliberate design.
> 
> *“But at the same time, it must be observed, that none of these parts or principles, however useful, are so accurately adjusted, as to keep precisely within those bounds in which their utility consists; but they are, all of them, apt, on every occasion, to run into the one extreme or the other. One would imagine, that this grand production had not received the last hand of the maker; so little finished is every part, and so coarse are the strokes with which it is executed. Thus, the winds are requisite to convey the vapours along the surface of the globe, and to assist men in navigation: but how oft, rising up to tempests and hurricanes, do they become pernicious? Rains are necessary to nourish all the plants and animals of the earth: but how often are they defective? how often excessive? Heat is requisite to all life and vegetation; but is not always found in the due proportion. On the mixture and secretion of the humours and juices of the body depend the health and prosperity of the animal: but the parts perform not regularly their proper function. What more useful than all the passions of the mind, ambition, vanity, love, anger? But how oft do they break their bounds, and cause the greatest convulsions in society? There is nothing so advantageous in the universe, but what frequently becomes pernicious, by its excess or defect; nor has Nature guarded, with the requisite accuracy, against all disorder or confusion. The irregularity is never perhaps so great as to destroy any species; but is often sufficient to involve the individuals in ruin and misery.”*

All of these many, many examples of flawed or purposeless design can be used as evidence against nature being deliberately designed.
