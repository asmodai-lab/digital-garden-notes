The cosmological argument is very similar to the teleological argument, but — again — you do need to remember the differences. 
> if you don't remember how to differentiate them, go [[01 - Philosophy/01 Philosophy/Teleological#Differentiating the two\|here]]

The Cosmological argument can be traced back to Aristotle, and his idea of the Prime Mover. This is the ancestor of the cosmological argument, and can be a useful synoptic link.

As with the teleological notes, these tend to jump around a bit, due to me embedding the relevant criticisms in the proponents: so some sections will appear twice. The reason they don't appear only once is in order to make finding specifically the criticisms by themselves easier.

## Versions of the cosmological argument
### From causation
#### Aristotle's prime mover
Aristotle argued that the natural state of matter is rest — as is similar to Newton's first law of motion: *a body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless it is acted upon by a force*: aka objects will continue as they are unless acted upon by a force.

However, since there is motion in the universe (like the constant expansion, or motion/orbit of stars), this motion must be sustained by something beyond the physical world. To avoid the infinite regress, Aristotle proposed the prime mover: unmoved and eternal.

The prime mover is pure actuality, incapable of change, and acts as a final cause: i.e. pulling things towards their telos rather than pushing things into motion.

Furthermore, Aristotle argues that since matter is changeable, the prime mover cannot be material, and must be an immaterial mind. And — since it is unchanging — the mind can only contemplate itself: i.e. 'thought thinking itself'. 
> This is the major difference of prime mover -> cosmological arguments; because it is entirely inert and non-interactive. 

#### The Kalam Argument (non-Christian ver)
Arguably the first 'modern' cosmological argument. It was initially created by Christian Philosopher John Philoponus in the 6th century and later revived by Islamic thinker al-Ghazali in the 11th century.
> Obviously, we are doing the Christian side of the course: but this is the first paper, so referencing an Islamic thinker should be fine: especially as Christian and Islamic ideas of God are both Abrahamic.

The argument is summarized like this:
> P₁ : whatever begins to exist has a cause
> P₂ : the universe began to exist
> C₁ : the universe has a cause (and this cause is God)

We have good evidence for the first premise being true. Things don't typically spring into existence without a cause.

For the second premise, proof came after these thinker's time. Modern cosmology supports the premise that the universe 'began': based on the observation that the universe is expanding.

So, therefore the inference from the two premises to the conclusion — specifically that the universe has a cause, not that the cause is God — is *logically valid.*
> This does not necessarily mean irrefutably correct, just that it makes no formal  mistakes in either it's premises, or following it's premises to the conclusion.

### The possibility of an eternal universe

 The Big Bang model argues that the universe — at least as we currently understand it — came into existence about 13.8 billion years ago. 
 > this does support the second premise of the Kalam argument.
 
 While it's the mainstream model, it isn't universally accepted: nobody knows for certain what actually happened. The explanation that the universe just came from nothing 14 billion years ago is unsatisfying.
 > this is a bit of a strawman. The Big Bang is not that the universe came from nothing, just that there wasn't anything recognisable until the big bang.
 
 So, some ask what happened before the big bang or if anything caused the big bang.

There are other theories for the beginning of the universe: like the oscillating universe model. It proposes that the universe continually expands and contracts. The big bang wasn't the absolute beginning, just the beginning of a cycle.
> if this is the case then the Kalam argument is false, because the universe did not 'begin' to exist.

#### Aquinas
##### First way and second way (I like to move it move it)
Aka his 'argument from motion' — outlined in the *Summa Theologica*.

For Aquinas, motion doesn't just mean physical location change, but any kind of change - like wood becoming hot when set on fire. Before the fire, the wood is potentially hot, and after the fire it is actually hot. Motion is the transition from potential to actual.

So, with this in mind, here is Aquinas' first way:
> P₁ : things in the world are in motion
> P₂ : anything in motion must have been moved by something else
> C₁: if the chain goes on forever, there's no first mover
>  C₂ : but, if there is no first mover, that contradicts P₂. And, according to P₁, we know that motion exists, so it cannot be the case that P₁ is false.
>C₃ : there must be a first mover 
>P₃ : this first mover is God.

This might sound a bit like the Kalām argument at first because it also talks about a chain of causes. But where the Kalām argument talks about a sequence of causes _stretching backward in time_ – a horizontal chain – Aquinas is talking about a vertical chain of causes _happening right now_ – a vertical hierarchy of dependence in the present moment.

- The water is hot
- Because of the pot
- Which is hot because of the fire
- Which is burning because of a chemical reaction
- Which is possible because of the structure of atoms and the laws of physics
- And so on.

Whereas a horizontal cause might look something like this:

- The water is hot
- Which was caused by someone putting the pot of water on the fire
- The fire was caused by the person lighting a match
- They struck the match because they wanted to boil water for coffee
- …
- The person was caused to exist by their parents
- …
- The person’s parents were caused to exist by their grandparents
- …
- The Earth formed
- … 13.8 billion years of causes…
- The Big Bang
- ??? (God, for many proposers)

So, horizontal arguments are about the origin of the universe. Vertical arguments are about causes that explain things in the present moment. *How did everything begin* versus *What is sustaining everything right now?*
> for Aquinas, God is a continuing cause. What He is causing is the laws of physics, mostly: like heat, gravity, energy, etc.

All of these things are happening at the same time. They're part of a vertical chain, not a horizontal one going backwards in time. Aquinas argues that this vertical chain cannot go on forever — you need something at the top: something that causes change and isn't changed itself: pure actuality with no potential: God.
> So, unlike the Kalam argument, the first way still works in an oscillating universe. Even if time stretched back infinitely, the whole chain of causes still wouldn't explain why anything moves *right now.* To properly explain motion (both horizontally and vertically) — we need a cause, not just something that kicked off the process some time in the past. This being is God.

You may be thinking that this argument kind of sucks. And you'd be correct. Logically, it makes no sense to differentiate horizontal and vertical causes, they just come from the same thing. It's just stating things with no backup.
> Although if you agree with Aquinas, then yes — an infinite universe where God exists is technically possible. As long as you ignore the argument that the universe itself has a cause. 

FYI, the second way is just the same argument as motion but replacing motion with 'cause.'
- The world is full of causes and effects
- Nothing can cause itself
- Every cause needs a prior cause
- If this sequence goes on forever, there’s no first cause
- But if there’s no first cause, there’d be no causes at all
- But we know causes exist
- So there must be a first cause
- And this first cause is God

Same thing with the vertical and horizontal causes. Here's a diagram explaining

### Is the first cause God?

Even if you accept that there must be a first cause, there is no reason for it to be God — specifically the God as described in abrahamic religion: omniscient, omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and personal.

You could just argue that the first cause is something else: like some fundamental law of physics, or brute fact, or something more similar to the Prime Mover.
> Maybe, if you trace the chain of causes far enough, you just hit a point where the laws of reality _just are_ – that you reach a foundational level of explanation at which point there is no further reason. For example, science may say that eventually you reach a base-level quantum field or some other impersonal thing and that the story stops there.

Even if we accept that everything has a cause, and then accept the conclusion that the universe has a cause, it is a non-sequitur to assume that this cause is God.
> at best, these arguments prove a first cause or first mover: nothing in them even remotely proves God.

### Hume's objections to the causal principle
All cosmological arguments (so far) assume some variation of the causal principle: i.e. that everything has a cause.

Hume, however, doesn't like this. he says that there is 2 **and only 2** ways that we can know things:
1. as relations of ideas (via logic — a priori)
2. as matters of fact (via experience — a posteriori)

You can know something as a relation of ideas if it is impossible to imagine/prove it false. So, you can know 'triangles have 3 sides' as a relation of ideas: because the idea of a 4 sided triangle isn't coherent: it's contradictory.
> We can apply this to the causal principle: and we don't get the same result. We can imagine an effect without a cause. I can picture a chair without a cause: the idea makes sense. Even if we never experience this in reality, the idea at least makes sense: it's conceivable in a way that the 4 sided triangle isn't. 
> > this shows that the causal principle is not a relation of ideas.

You can know something as a matter of fact from experience. But Hume argues that we never actually experience causation. We never actually experience A *causing* B, we only experience that B *follows* A.
> Hume is undermining the causal principle. The belief in it is just a custom, he argues, something that the mind imagines and projects onto what it has experienced seeing B follow A enough times. But how do we know that this belief will hold? Will B always follow A? There's nothing logically necessary about it, and so it could just be false.
> 
> This doubt is even stronger when talking about the origin/creation of the universe: we only learn to expect B to follow A from *within the universe* — through repeated experience of one event consistently following another. But with cosmological arguments, we are applying B follows A to something outside the universe. As Hume points out: 
 
 >[!quote] "it is only after a long course of uniform experiments... that we attain a firm reliance and security regarding a particular event"

So, even if everything that we have observed within the universe has a cause, that doesn't justify applying the causal principle beyond the universe. The creation of the universe is unique: we don't have multiple examples of universes beginning to exist. So, without a larger sample size, Hume argues that inferring a cause isn't justified.

**This is doubt on the key premise of the cosmological arguments from causation, because it criticises the causation principle itself.**
>[!tip] Note on using this in essays
> This criticism is an *informal fallacy*: which means it doesn't infallibly disprove the cosmological argument.

#### Descartes' argument (yes it DOES have to be God)
This one is bloody long-winded, but it does provide reasoning for why the first cause must be God (all the omnis plus perfect) specifically.

In his book, Meditations 3, Descartes goes through process of elimination to explain his argument.

> [!quote] Descartes' argument

Option 1: I am the cause of my own existence
- Descartes rules this out because if it was true, he would have made himself perfect
Option 2: I have always existed
- Firstly, he rules this out because he would be aware of this
- Secondly, it doesn't explain his continuing to exist. Again, even if there's an infinite horizontal series of causes, that doesn't explain what sustains existence. The fact that I'm alive right now does not cause me to be alive in the next moment.
Option 3: My parents or some other being is the cause of my existence
- he rules this out because your parents still don't provide an explanation for your *continued* existence — i.e. the vertical chain of causes.
- Plus, even if your parents were the horizontal cause of your existence, that causes the question of what caused them, and so on to infinity: which is impossible.
**This only leaves one explanation: God.**

He has a few more arguments on why this must be God specifically.
1. as mentioned, there can't be an infinite regress of causes — eventually you reach something which *is* cause in and of itself. And, as mentioned, anything that causes itself would make it's own existence perfect: i.e. God.
2. because of the causal adequacy principle, Descartes says that the cause of an effect but have at least us much 'reality' as the effect. And since Descartes has an idea of a perfect, infinite being: the only thing that could've caused that idea must be something that itself is perfect and infinite: so, God.
	 *“And the whole force of the argument I have used here to prove the existence of God consists in this, that I recognize that it would not be possible for my nature to be as it is, that is to say, that I should have in me the idea of a God, if God did not really exist;”*

### From contingency (you will never escape the ontological argument)
#### Aquinas' third way (why am I not dead yet?: the argument)
The third way is a different kind of cosmological argument: one from contingency, not causation.
> Where all the above arguments assume some variation of the causal principle, contingency arguments rely on ideas of necessity and contingency.

| Contingent                                                                                   | Necessary                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Does exist, but still contains the possibility of non-existence.                             | Cannot contain the possibility of non-existence: i.e. it's impossible for it to not exist                    |
| For example: this website exists, but if I didn't decide to make it, then it wouldn't exist. | For example, God is said to exist necessarily: His existence not being caused or dependent on anything else. |
We are contingent beings. If you parents never met, then you wouldn't have been born: your existence is **contingent** on them. 
> contingent= reliant/dependant on

Pretty much everything that we can observe exists contingently.
- seed isn't planted -> the plant doesn't exist
- sun didn't form -> Earth wouldn't have formed either
- big bang didn't happen -> universe (as we know it) wouldn't exist (debatably.)
So, Aquinas' third way is thus:
> P₁: things in the world exists contingently 
> 	 - P₁: whatever exists contingently did not exist at some point in time
> P₂: if everything were contingent, then at some point in time, nothing would have existed (**TAKE NOTE THAT THIS IS A PROPOSITION: SOMETHING YOU CAN AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH WITHOUT LOGICAL REASONING. THIS IS NOT AN ARGUMENT, THIS IS AN OBSERVATION.**)
>  C₁: but if nothing existed at some point, then nothing could have come into existence.
>  P₃: since some things begin to exist, there was never nothing in existence
>  C₂: therefore, there must be something that does not exist contingently, but exists necessarily in order to make sure that there was never a point where 'nothing' was in existence
> P₁ : this being is God

If everything were a thing which can 'not-exist' then it's hard to see why anything exists now: because there must have been a point where nothing existed (as in this example, everything is contingent) but nothing cannot cause something: so there must be at least one necessary being in existence as to explain contingent beings existing.

First of all, refer back to [[01 - Philosophy/01 Philosophy/Cosmological#Is the first cause God?\|why does the first cause have to be God?]] for your easiest criticism of this argument.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/01-philosophy/01-philosophy/cosmological/#the-infinite-series" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



### The infinite series
The weakest premise of the third way is that 'if everything were contingent, then at some point in time: nothing existed.'

One might argue that — like with the oscillating universe — that there could be an infinite chain of contingent beings. If this infinite sequence is possible, then everything could be contingent without there ever being a time where nothing existed.

There is a response to this: i.e. that infinity is a paradoxical idea. One way to illustrate this is with a famous thought experiment called Hilbert's Hotel. Here's a quick video explaining it:

![Hilbert's Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj3_KqkI9Zo)

But to explain it in writing (although I strongly recommend you watch the video: it makes this concept significantly easier to understand):

- Hilbert's Hotel is a hotel with infinite rooms, all of which are occupied.
- despite being fully booked, the hotel can still accommodate new guests via shifting everyone into a different room.
- so, the hotel is **both fully occupied, and able to take on more guests**: which is contradictory.

This is arguing that infinities are paradoxical, which is impossible: and so suggests that an infinity cannot actually exist.
> so infinite regress (which would be required if there isn't a first cause) is implied to be impossible.

### My personal bone(s) to pick
I personally think that the premises and conclusions of the cosmological arguments from contingency are non-sequiturs. If the premise is that everything in the universe is contingent on something else, then there cannot be a being which is not contingent (i.e. necessary) because that being must be contingent on something else.

Frankly, we don't know enough about the universe to know if infinity is possible. Also, as humans we cannot comprehend infinity: we can barely comprehend a 'million'! We can't know if it's possible if we cannot comprehend it.

#### Leibniz's argument (or: the toddler asking 'why?')
Leibniz's argument is the **principle of sufficient reason.** Essentially, that there must always be a reason why something is the case.
> For example, water freezes at zero degrees because of the physical properties of water molecules. Or, the reason that Kier Starmer is Prime Minister is because he was elected. 

There is always a reason behind something, even if we don't know or can't know what that reason is.
> In physics, gravity is weaker than nuclear forces, and nobody knows why.
> > but the principle of sufficient reason holds: there will ultimately be a reason why gravity is weaker than nuclear forces, we just haven't discovered it yet, or maybe we will never discover it.

Leibniz then applies this to two different kinds of truth:
1. necessary truths — or 'truths of reasoning' (a priori)
	1. like 2+2=4. Truths that are revealed by analysis, and are self-evident. To understand what 2+2=4 **means** is to understand that it must be true.
2. contingent truths — or 'truths of fact' (a posteriori)
	1. any explanation for contingent truths will just be more contingent truths: which will also require explanations
	2. like with the fact that water freezes at zero degrees. You could explain this by saying it is because of the properties of water molecules, but this raises questions of why water molecules are arranged that way, and why the laws of physics are the way they are.
	3. so, infinite regress part infinity.

Leibniz argues that to break this infinite regress so as to give sufficient reason for contingent truths is that something must exist necessarily: i.e. God.
> So, his argument is thus:
> P₁: every true fact as a reason why it is true
> P₂: we cannot find sufficient reason for contingent truths without referring to other contingent truths, which also need sufficient reason
> P₃: an infinite sequence of contingent truths would not provide sufficient reason
> C₁: in order to provide sufficient reason for contingent truths, we need to appeal to a necessary being/substance
> P₁: this is God

Assuming that something true of part of a thing must be true of the whole of that thing. Conversely, the fallacy of division is assuming that something true of a whole thing must be true of all or some of it's parts. 

It's also related to the fallacy of hasty generalization, in which an incorrect inference is made from a statement about a sample -> to a statement about the population from which the sample is drawn. (like small samples in science being unreliable.)

Russell argues that the cosmological arguments make the same mistake: *just because everything **within** the universe has a cause/explanation, it does not necessarily follow that the universe **itself** has a cause/explanation.*

This was iterated in the **Copleston/Russell radio debate**, and is also known as the 'blunt fact' idea.
> "*I should say that the universe is just there, and that's all.*"

There is, however, a response to this. The fallacy of composition is an **informal fallacy**. This means that whether or not the argument using the fallacy is invalid depends on the context or content.

So, his response to the critique that cosmological arguments commit the fallacy of composition is thus:

> C₁ : the universe itself exists contingently.

Following on from that, going by the principle of sufficient reason, we still require an explanation of the universe: *why is there something rather than nothing?* Copleston says that the only way we can explain the existence of our contingent universe is with a necessary being: God.

## Issues with the cosmological argument
### The possibility of an eternal universe

 The Big Bang model argues that the universe — at least as we currently understand it — came into existence about 13.8 billion years ago. 
 > this does support the second premise of the Kalam argument.
 
 While it's the mainstream model, it isn't universally accepted: nobody knows for certain what actually happened. The explanation that the universe just came from nothing 14 billion years ago is unsatisfying.
 > this is a bit of a strawman. The Big Bang is not that the universe came from nothing, just that there wasn't anything recognisable until the big bang.
 
 So, some ask what happened before the big bang or if anything caused the big bang.

There are other theories for the beginning of the universe: like the oscillating universe model. It proposes that the universe continually expands and contracts. The big bang wasn't the absolute beginning, just the beginning of a cycle.
> if this is the case then the Kalam argument is false, because the universe did not 'begin' to exist.


### The infinite series
The weakest premise of the third way is that 'if everything were contingent, then at some point in time: nothing existed.'

One might argue that — like with the oscillating universe — that there could be an infinite chain of contingent beings. If this infinite sequence is possible, then everything could be contingent without there ever being a time where nothing existed.

There is a response to this: i.e. that infinity is a paradoxical idea. One way to illustrate this is with a famous thought experiment called Hilbert's Hotel. Here's a quick video explaining it:

![Hilbert's Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj3_KqkI9Zo)

But to explain it in writing (although I strongly recommend you watch the video: it makes this concept significantly easier to understand):

- Hilbert's Hotel is a hotel with infinite rooms, all of which are occupied.
- despite being fully booked, the hotel can still accommodate new guests via shifting everyone into a different room.
- so, the hotel is **both fully occupied, and able to take on more guests**: which is contradictory.

This is arguing that infinities are paradoxical, which is impossible: and so suggests that an infinity cannot actually exist.
> so infinite regress (which would be required if there isn't a first cause) is implied to be impossible.

### Is the first cause God?

Even if you accept that there must be a first cause, there is no reason for it to be God — specifically the God as described in abrahamic religion: omniscient, omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and personal.

You could just argue that the first cause is something else: like some fundamental law of physics, or brute fact, or something more similar to the Prime Mover.
> Maybe, if you trace the chain of causes far enough, you just hit a point where the laws of reality _just are_ – that you reach a foundational level of explanation at which point there is no further reason. For example, science may say that eventually you reach a base-level quantum field or some other impersonal thing and that the story stops there.

Even if we accept that everything has a cause, and then accept the conclusion that the universe has a cause, it is a non-sequitur to assume that this cause is God.
> at best, these arguments prove a first cause or first mover: nothing in them even remotely proves God.

### Hume's objections to the causal principle
All cosmological arguments (so far) assume some variation of the causal principle: i.e. that everything has a cause.

Hume, however, doesn't like this. he says that there is 2 **and only 2** ways that we can know things:
1. as relations of ideas (via logic — a priori)
2. as matters of fact (via experience — a posteriori)

You can know something as a relation of ideas if it is impossible to imagine/prove it false. So, you can know 'triangles have 3 sides' as a relation of ideas: because the idea of a 4 sided triangle isn't coherent: it's contradictory.
> We can apply this to the causal principle: and we don't get the same result. We can imagine an effect without a cause. I can picture a chair without a cause: the idea makes sense. Even if we never experience this in reality, the idea at least makes sense: it's conceivable in a way that the 4 sided triangle isn't. 
> > this shows that the causal principle is not a relation of ideas.

You can know something as a matter of fact from experience. But Hume argues that we never actually experience causation. We never actually experience A *causing* B, we only experience that B *follows* A.
> Hume is undermining the causal principle. The belief in it is just a custom, he argues, something that the mind imagines and projects onto what it has experienced seeing B follow A enough times. But how do we know that this belief will hold? Will B always follow A? There's nothing logically necessary about it, and so it could just be false.
> 
> This doubt is even stronger when talking about the origin/creation of the universe: we only learn to expect B to follow A from *within the universe* — through repeated experience of one event consistently following another. But with cosmological arguments, we are applying B follows A to something outside the universe. As Hume points out: 
 
 >[!quote] "it is only after a long course of uniform experiments... that we attain a firm reliance and security regarding a particular event"

So, even if everything that we have observed within the universe has a cause, that doesn't justify applying the causal principle beyond the universe. The creation of the universe is unique: we don't have multiple examples of universes beginning to exist. So, without a larger sample size, Hume argues that inferring a cause isn't justified.

**This is doubt on the key premise of the cosmological arguments from causation, because it criticises the causation principle itself.**
>[!tip] Note on using this in essays
> This criticism is an *informal fallacy*: which means it doesn't infallibly disprove the cosmological argument.

### Fallacy of composition
Assuming that something true of part of a thing must be true of the whole of that thing. Conversely, the fallacy of division is assuming that something true of a whole thing must be true of all or some of it's parts. 

It's also related to the fallacy of hasty generalization, in which an incorrect inference is made from a statement about a sample -> to a statement about the population from which the sample is drawn. (like small samples in science being unreliable.)

Russell argues that the cosmological arguments make the same mistake: *just because everything **within** the universe has a cause/explanation, it does not necessarily follow that the universe **itself** has a cause/explanation.*

This was iterated in the **Copleston/Russell radio debate**, and is also known as the 'blunt fact' idea.
> "*I should say that the universe is just there, and that's all.*"

Following on from that, going by the principle of sufficient reason, we still require an explanation of the universe: *why is there something rather than nothing?* Copleston says that the only way we can explain the existence of our contingent universe is with a necessary being: God.


### The impossibility of a necessary being
Contingency arguments say that the universe is made up of contingent beings (things that are able to not exist), so there must be something that exists necessarily to explain why anything exists. However, Hume questions whether a necessary being is even possible.
> Hume says that if God did exist necessarily, then it would be contradictory and therefore inconceivable to imagine God not existing. According to Hume, if God did exist necessarily, then trying to imagine a world where God does not exist would be as impossible as imagining a 4-sided triangle: the terms would contradict each other.
> 
> but, 'God does not exist' is conceivable and not obviously self-contradictory: Hume says that God cannot exist necessarily.

Russel makes a similar point in the radio debate:
> [!quote] Russel's point in the radio debate
> *“The word “necessary” I should maintain, can only be applied significantly to propositions. And, in fact, only to such as are analytic – that is to say – such as it is self-contradictory to deny. I could only admit a necessary being if there were a being whose existence it is self-contradictory to deny.”*

He is saying that if God exists necessarily, then 'God exists' would be an analytic truth: something that is true by definition: like 'all bachelors are unmarried' or 'all triangles have only 3 sides'. If God's existence was an analytical truth, then 'God does not exist' would be a contradiction.

Since it isn't contradictory, God existing cannot be an analytic truth, and it follows that God cannot be a necessary being.

Proponents of the contingency arguments, however, may argue that this conflates the two meanings of necessary.
- the 'necessary' that Russell is using here is referring to necessary truths, which are - in purpose - the same as analytic truths: truths that cannot be denied because doing so would be contradictory.
- However, 'necessary' is cosmological arguments is in the sense of the property of necessary existence: something that cannot be reliant on anything else to exists.

So, when contingency arguments say that God is a necessary being, they don't mean that 'God exists' is a necessary truth. They're saying that if God exists, it is within God's nature to exist necessarily.

In other words, Russell and Hume may be right to say that 'a necessary being does not exist' is not logically contradictory. But that doesn't settle whether it exists, just that the statement 'a necessary being exists' isn't true by definition.

### My personal bone(s) to pick
I personally think that the premises and conclusions of the cosmological arguments from contingency are non-sequiturs. If the premise is that everything in the universe is contingent on something else, then there cannot be a being which is not contingent (i.e. necessary) because that being must be contingent on something else.

Frankly, we don't know enough about the universe to know if infinity is possible. Also, as humans we cannot comprehend infinity: we can barely comprehend a 'million'! We can't know if it's possible if we cannot comprehend it.
