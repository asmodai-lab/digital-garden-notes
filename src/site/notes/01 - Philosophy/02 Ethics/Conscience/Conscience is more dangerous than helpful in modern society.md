| > Allows for a dangerous level of interpretation, putting humans on the throne of God.<br> | > It specifically doesn't do that, because Aquinas takes one's knowledge of a situation into account. | > However, by taking knowledge of a situation into account, Aquinas acknowledges the issue of multiculturalism and cannot pretend that it isn't an issue if he is indirectly using it to justify his system                       | Aquinas |

| > Absolute morality doesn't exist and/or can't be discovered by humans                     | > Strawmanning. Aquinas' system isn't absolutist.                                                     | But it argues that we have some access to absolute morality via 'God-given' reason, which is then changed by our knowledge of a situation. But this implies that people are always acting with their conscience, which is untrue. | Aquinas |
| > Freud's justifications reflect how morality works and doesn't put humans on a pedestal.  | > Freud's system is reductionistic.

> If using Aquinas' system, conscience is dangerous because one can justify their actions using the idea of 'God', when God is unknowable. 
> 	case study— divine right of kings (using God as a mouthpiece for human ideas)
> However, taking the proposition as 'we should get rid of morals' is ridiculous. As Freud argued, our conscience is inseparable from our personality, because it is the tool we use to satisfy our base desires whilst avoiding pain/punishment — which is arguably what makes our society function.
> 
> In reality, the question is so vague as to be a useless one to ask.
