| **Agape**                          | Love is all that matters in ethics. He thinks the 10 commandments don’t matter, only love does.<br><br>**Agape is a selfless love**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Polyamory – to not be adulterous. As long as the partner is still loved, adultery doesn’t matter (?) On the other hand, forms of polyamory could be selfish, prioritising the self by having multiple partners rather than being devoted to one person<br><br>Sex work, is this selfless? Definitely selfish on both sides, exploitative and not actually love. Lust instead.<br><br>Homosexuality and Christianity – Fletcher may think that it doesn’t matter whether someone is homosexual or not, as long as it is true and pure love. This may contradict Christian ideas – especially Catholic                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **The four working principles**    | 1.       Pragmatism: it is based on experience rather than on theory<br><br>2.       Relativism: it is based on making the absolute laws of Christian ethics relative<br><br>3.       Positivism: it begins with belief in the reality and importance of love<br><br>4.       Personalism: persons, not laws or anything else, are at the centre of situation ethics                      | Polyamory: evaluated by whether multiple relationships genuinely foster love, honesty and care rather than harm. Not “always wrong” - depends on honesty, consent etc. If relationships are grounded in agape (selfless love), they can be morally valid. The dignity and happiness of individuals matter more than traditional monogamy rules.<br><br>Sex work:<br><br>Judged by whether it protects workers’ dignity and safety. Context matters – exploitation is wrong but consensual safe sex work can be morally acceptable. If motivated by care (e.g. providing for a family) it can align with love. Protecting workers’ rights and safety is most important. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **The six fundamental principles** | 1.       Love is the only intrinsically good thing<br><br>2.       Love is the ruling norm in ethics<br><br>3.       Love is justice distributed<br><br>4.       Love wills the neighbours good regardless of if you like your neighbour<br><br>5.       Only the end justifies the means<br><br>6.       Love decides on each situation as it occurs — without a set of laws to guide it | **This follows for all sub-topics that could be asked in sexual ethics:**<br><br>Because there are no laws and morals are decided upon from situation to situation, as long as the decision abides by the first 5 principles, it is always ethical.<br><br>Whether something is ‘loving’ is that which you have to define for yourself. Is pain loving? Is the end loving — can ends be loving in a capitalist system which demands money? Is it entirely focussed on ‘loving’ over any other moral laws_? What even is love in any given situation_? **All of which are subjective.**                                                                                 | Could talk about the Lavender Brown hair thing: she did it for money, as is the case with 99% of sex work. Is that loving?<br><br>Could talk about pornography. People sharing it for joy with each other — means (sexual trafficking, immoral acts) could be argued to not matter? Or perhaps is the end if we define the end as widespread immoral sexual acts — then not ethical? |
| **Conscious**                      | -Fletcher: conscious a verb not a noun; a term that describes attempts to make decisions creatively<br><br>-> helps us figure things out<br><br>-process of figuring out what the loving thing to do in a situation is<br><br>-it is not a ‘thing’; not a set moral compass                                                                                                               | Polyamory- is it truly the loving solution in a given situation?<br><br>-Some engage in polyamory to satisfy another partner’s desire for multiple relationships, not necessarily maintaining their own happiness<br><br>-> this is more harmful than loving<br><br>--> jealousy and insecurity are often introduced in poly relationships                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Talk about the tragedy of Jerry (Love Without Limits)- feels neglected, insecure (compared to Joe sexually)<br><br>-> unfair treatment towards Jerry from Heidi                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

You could also reject it because it undermines the purpose of a marriage leading to procreation and spiritual unity. <br><br>Sex work: Sex work doesn’t build virtue as having relations becomes more of a business transaction. It also is against the telos of sexuality which is procreation, but it may also be a positive way to prevent worse things. <br><br>Pornography: It encourages lust which limits human flourishing and does not reach the telos of virtue. Removes sexual pleasure from its telos <br><br>BDSM: If it isn’t cruel and cultivates virtue then it’s telos is okay. But it can also distort the natural telos of sex <br><br>Homosexuality and Christianity: wouldnt be judged whether it fosters flourishing or friendship                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
