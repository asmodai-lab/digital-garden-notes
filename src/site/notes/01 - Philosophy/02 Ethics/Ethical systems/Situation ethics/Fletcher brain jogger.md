Framework

Fletcher said that there were two unattractive views in ethics.
{ #13n26pSo}


Legalism
{ #WT5NC6aB}


Antinomianism
{ #YVZs6Cjg}


(aka: deontological)
{ #MZmJ8EPl}


no laws/principles, do whatever you want
{ #KjW2Thl2}


Middle ethics: Situationism
{ #26SvDgXl}


There is a moral law, so Fletcher rejects antinomianism
{ #qBfNowlk}


There is only one moral law, so Fletcher rejects legalism
{ #MM9SkRgw}


This one law is agape: selfless love.
{ #cKmBu1E0}


Fletcher thinks that there can be moral principles, but these differ from laws.
{ #C9OW30xf}


Principles are generalizations which are context-sensitive, and derive from the one law.
{ #FapMLzaN}


From the universal law, we can only derive principles, not other universal laws.
{ #zOcrKZbQ}


'we cannot milk a universal from a universal.'
{ #diwu8YeJ}


The four working principles
{ #ky2dPEqO}


Pragmatism
{ #rPSvBbNc}


Relativism
{ #kjcHD8oz}


Positivism
{ #UMyqNXfq}


Personalism
{ #HeSpB6E1}


Focus on how to use morals in real life situations, no abstractions.
{ #j53R4JfR}


Any moral or value judgement in ethics is a decision, not a conclusion.
{ #sUwENhDb}


So, when challenged as to how he can justify that the only law is to maximise love, Fletcher will say that he cannot.
{ #MF3HiV38}


It's not a result of logic or reasoning, it is like a 'theologian's faith'.
{ #NUFQlIAe}


Even rejecting antinomianism, Fletcher still calls himself a relativist.
{ #RtTM74iq}


This doesn't mean that we can choose what is right or wrong, more that we need to take situations into account when laying down the law.
{ #xAkIEKKL}


Love is experienced by people.
{ #XCQAhnlZ}


So, to maximise love, we need to consider the "who" of a situation.
{ #Q6QxCQmu}


'Love is of people, by people, for people. Things are to be used; people are to be loved... loving actions are the only conduct permissible.'
{ #N8g5Hykc}


The six propositions
{ #GYPVeDG6}


Love is the only thing that is intrinsically good.
{ #3DyLnun9}


The ruling norm of Christian decision is love, nothing else
{ #oB756XQt}


Love and justice are the same -- love is justice distributed.
{ #R4CWmYk9}


Love wills the neighbour's good, whether we like him or not.
{ #shtElXac}


Only the ends justify the means, nothing else
{ #1RJI1fCK}


Love's decisions are made situationally, not prescriptively.
{ #AhkRb4wS}


Fletcher has this thing called the agapeic calculus
{ #EtLjJh0h}


reminiscient of the hedonic calculus.
{ #DHvotggJ}


'the greatest amount of neighbour welfare for the largest number of neighbours possible.'
{ #97qA04MR}


He says 'welfare', not 'love', because agape is not about having feelings or desires.
{ #qeu8LLHH}


Directly rejecting deontological approaches.
{ #OfNFKGIN}


any action we take, as considered as independent of it's consequences, is "meaningless and pointless."
{ #dveaFq6e}


Ethical decisions are not cut and dried. No decision can be made before considering the situation.
{ #e54KZeNY}


It respects individuals and communities and what they value.
{ #saHdPtVs}


avoids detached moral decision making
{ #7msFTZEH}


love (agape) tends to bring about happiness
{ #GvS30osh}


it's focussed on the wellbeing of others
{ #GJpGw75u}


it still provides a framework while allowing one to take a situation into account.
{ #wuDDRBSn}


because it has only one truth, morals are up to interpretation
{ #GJtKbRsb}


changes based on the situation, so people don't have an easy way to know how to act
{ #C0yao1ND}


What is love? baby don't hurt me
{ #M4ke53se}


what the 'most loving thing' is, is up for interpretation.
{ #mMiSISBq}


can be impractical to consider all outcomes before acting
{ #qoTc5BSG}


permits people to act evilly for a good result
{ #3KWcPmWX}


Fletcher's definition of conciousness is reductionistic
{ #FhWiDJWh}


most people review their actions afterwards to consider if they acted correctly.
{ #H7izKTBr}


Doesn't go by fundamental biblical principles, despite being Christian.
{ #sUSMRVok}


Argues that it may even be your duty to break biblical principles for the sake of agape.
{ #MpPsIZaP}


Conciousness
{ #6szDw9YW}


Consciousness is a verb, not a noun. It enables us to figure out how to apply agape in any situation.
{ #LKCbC4DF}


He disagrees with the view that conscience is an intuitive, internal moral compass.
{ #bMT0ntEZ}


it's selfless love: doesn't allow for desire to cloud decision making
{ #JV0fbd65}
