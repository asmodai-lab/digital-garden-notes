# FAQ


How is this organised?
> This is organised into subject, then topic, then lesson. To find essay plans, go through the essay plans home page, which is sorted by paper for philosophy, and for politics is an unsorted list of questions with a table of contents. 


What are excalidrawings?
> They are inserted PDFs/mind maps which I use to essay plan in a more organic way.

How do I navigate excalidrawings?
> Use the middle mouse button to move around, and Ctrl + Shift to zoom — or use finger gestures on the mousepad.

What do the colours in excalidrawings mean?

What are you using to do this?
> I use Obsidian to make notes — it's a free note-taking app. To make the website, I used the Digital Garden plugin. All of this was entirely free and relatively easy.

How do I do this?
> Here is my [[09 - Bear hunt/Basic obsidian tutorial\|Basic obsidian tutorial]]. Enjoy.

Why is {insert topic} not here?
> Because I haven't made the notes for it yet. This was started halfway through my A-Levels, I still haven't finished transferring my notes yet. 

Your notes suck!
>Your thoughts are very important to us. Please send an email to noreply@gov.uk and we will get back to you.
