Each state gives the exact same powers to the central government. The way that this is different to English devolution is that for England, power is given out from in — whereas in the USA it goes in from out. 
- In the UK, power given out is uneven.

## Why is america federal?

1. Historically 13 colonies- it was easy to carry on like that
2. The USA is very diverse in population, culture, and climate
3. It was seen as a good way of spreading power and minimising the chance of tyranny.
	- If there is any questions on whether something is a federal thing or a state thing- it is assumed to be a state power.
- The idea that power resides with the states is codified by the **tenth amendment**.
	- This has resulted in the US developing a strong culture of localism and regionalism- which is common in the UK devolved bodies but less so in England.

### How has federalism changed over time?

1.      Dual federalism- 1790s--1930s

The federal and state governments were very separate. The federal government is seen as intrusive. Tension over states rights led to the civil war over slavery. After the civil war, there is a period of reconstruction but there is still a shit ton of racist laws in the south.

2.      Co-operative federalism- 1930s-1960s

In ’29, the wall street crash causes the great depression. The US economy shrunk a shit ton. Then Roosevelt took control of large parts of the economy- i.e. publicization.

So he does the New Deal using the commerce clause- he is pushing it. The supreme court is anti-New Deal- but in 1937 he threatens to increase the number of court justices and flood the court with democrats.

3.      New federalism- 1960s- 2000s

The federal government was being seen as inefficient- conservativism is on the rise- many white southerners and deeply unhappy about policies that aren’t racist.

Then Nixon offers block grants to states to solve problems- but they don’t have to reach a goal or something. so they are given more autonomy.

4.      Who the fuck knows- 2000s-now

Everyone -starting with Bush- has changed it the fuck around.

#### 2000s federalism onwards

| The supreme court seems very willing to return important decisions (like abortion) to the states. States have control over driving age, euthanasia, gun control, and marijuana. | The supreme court is growing in power, meaning the federal government has more influence                                                                                    |
| Election regulations remain with states                                                                                                                                         | There have been notable landmark legislation from the federal government that has impacted states and been upheld numerous times by the supreme court (affordable care act) |
| Increasing hyper partisanship in federal government has resulted in gridlock- meaning states have to do more                                                                    | Rights are uniformly protected at federal level- such as respect for marriage act 2022. This level of protection supersedes any state-level law.                            |
| While federal law supersedes state law, in instances like the legalisation of marijuana- state law has gone above federal and gone unchallenged                                 | Certain national issues demand national response- like Covid-19, the Russia-Ukraine war, or inflation.                                                                      |
