# Exercise
## PrimeChoice Packers LLC 

They don't want Deborah to go full on with 'better treatment for farm animals' because it would cost them a lot more if Nowhere, Ohio had California-style animal rights laws. 

If she takes money from them, she doesn't have to be publicly pro-industry, but she can't make any changes to the status quo. 

# Terms
**527 s**- Tax-exempt organisations created to influence electoral outcomes but that cannot call for the election or defeat of a specific candidate. They can raise unlimited amounts. 
- But also, they still do political things, but more subtly. 

**Political Action Committees (PACS)** — Political organizations that can donate directly to a candidate's campaign up to $5, 000 per campaign. 

**Super PACS** — PACs that can raise an unlimited amount **and** they can call for the election or defeat of a candidate. They are not, however, allowed to directly co-coordinate with candidate's campaigns.
	Elon Musk founded one to support Trump. Remember when he was lottery-ing $1 million for anyone who could prove they voted Trump

**Soft Money** — Money donated to a political party, rather than a specific candidate, and used for 'party-building activities' rather than the direct endorsement of a candidate. It is subject to a few limits.

**Hard Money** — donations specifically towards a specific political candidate's campaign. This is subject to strict limits. But also you could just donate soft money closer to the election to make sure it gets spent on the candidate without going through the limits.
