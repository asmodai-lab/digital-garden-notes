# Is the electoral college fit for purpose?

## How are electoral college votes allocated to the states?

>The <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">EC</span> is a system used to choose the President of the United States. Instead of simply<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)"> counting all votes</span> across the country as <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">one total</span>:<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> the votes are organised by state</span>. 
>Each state is given a certain number of points, known as <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">electoral votes</span>, based on it's <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">population</span>. The larger the state population, the more<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> electoral votes </span>it receives. 
>	For example, California has <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">54,</span> and Wyoming has<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)"> 3. </span>
>		Every 10 years, a census is conducted, which can result in states gaining or losing electoral votes
>The way that number of votes a state receives is straightforward: 
>	the <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">number of senators</span> a state has,<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> plus</span> the number of members of the <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">House of Representatives</span> it sends to congress
>		The number of senators is always <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">2</span>. 
>			For example, Texas has<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)"> 2</span> senators and <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">32</span> representatives, so it has <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">34</span> electoral college votes.
>		Therefore, the minimum number of electoral college votes a state can have is <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">3</span>. 
>In addition, Washington DC is allocated<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)"> 3</span> EC votes under the <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">23rd amendment</span> (1961.)</span> 
>When all the EC votes are added together, they total **538**:
>	<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">435</span> from the House of Representatives, <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">100</span> from senators, and <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">3</span> from DC.
>To win the presidency, a candidate must get a majority of these;
>	<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">270</span> is the majority needed

### How the EC system works

1. people in each state vote for which candidate they prefer.
2. in <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">most</span> states, the candidate who gets the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">most votes</span> wins <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">all</span> of the state's<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> EC votes</span>.
3. once all the states have votes, the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> EC votes</span> are <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">added</span> up to <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">decide the winner.</span>
While this is usually winner-takes-all, Main and Nebraska split their ECVs depending on how many votes each candidate received. 

> [!NOTE] 
> This system means a candidate becomes president **not** by winning the most votes from people across the whole country, but by gaining the most EC votes. 

## The process

1. The popular vote
2. Certificates of Ascertainment issued
3. Safe Harbour Deadline
4. Electors meet and cast votes
5. Joint session of congress counts votes
6. Inauguration day

## The role of Delegates.

Technically speaking, the winning candidate does not win the EC votes immediately. Instead, they win a delegate who pledges to vote for them when the EC meets. 
- in 33 states (plus DC) there is a legal requirement for delegates to vote for who they pledged to vote for
- in 17 states, there is no law about this.
