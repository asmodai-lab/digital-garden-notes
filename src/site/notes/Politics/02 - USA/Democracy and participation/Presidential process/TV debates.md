Do US TV debates matter to US elections?

#lessonminor 

| Yes, they do matter                                                                                                                                  | No, they don't matter                                                                                                                 |

| (Technically, Clinton got a majority of votes.)                                                                                                      | Hillary Clinton 'won' each debate in 2016 according to the polls, but lost the election.                                              |
| Harris 'won' the debates, and then won 48% of the vote (Trump won 50%) despite coming in very late.                                                  | Events are largely focused in swing states- TV debates are worldwide.                                                                 |
| Because each candidate needs 15% in polls to get onto TV, it means that (in theory, but not in practice) there should be a wide range of candidates. | People will vote for whoever they wanted to win before anyway- TV debates don't change minds.                                         |
| ~67 million watch the TV debates- it also gets coverage on social media in clips.                                                                    | The electoral college fucks everyone over babes.                                                                                      |
| After Biden's **awful** debate, he dropped out of the election, suggesting that they have an affect on candidate's confidence.                       | The kind of people who watch the debates will be interested in politics- and these people are more likely to already have an opinion. |

*Since 1976, there has been an expectation for candidates to take part in televised debates. Candidates who are polling at an average of 15% in national polls are eligible to take part in presidential debates. For all recent debates, this has meant there have been only two candidates — one Democrat and one Republican, with third parties failing to meet the polling requirement. Despite the hype around these debates, numerous studies have concluded, ‘When it comes to shifting enough votes to decide the outcome of the election, presidential debates have rarely, if ever, mattered.’ In 2016, Hillary Clinton appeared to have ‘won’ each debate according to polling conducted afterwards but went on to lose the election.*
