Invisible primaries aren't even primaries.

People need lots of money to do primaries, which means they need financial backers. 

Some people are going to fall by the wayside because of the expensive nature of primaries.

*This* is the invisible primary.

#### How to be successful in an invisible primary

- have money
- have name recognition

### Why do you want to win the invisible primary?

The winner gets advantage from winning the invisible primary- by being a frontrunner. 

Also, the winner gets:
- a huge about of money for advertising
- support of major donors to get funding later on
- vocal support and endorsements from major office holders
- gained 'insider establishment' status because they are supported by the party leaders
- a sense of inevitability about your being chosen as winner
- significant media coverage

==Winning the invisible primary is a huge advantage, but not a guarantee.==

###### 2020 Democratic party primary

There were 29 notable figures running for the democratic primary. Over half withdrew before the first primaries- some of which were big names but didn't manage to get momentum.
- For example, Kamala Harris was one of them.
- BUT Pete Buttigieg, mostly unknown guy, did really well in the invisible primary (he was clear, former soldier, and gay). He wins the Iowa caucus, despite being almost unknown beforehand.
	- But he came up against Bernie Sanders (who he disliked because he was a centrist)
	- so then a bunch drop out to support Biden in order to beat Bernie

###### 2016 Republican Primary

Jeb Bush (yes, that Bush) won the invisible primary and is very popular in the establishment. 
- however, in Iowa, he only wins 1/30 delegates, with Trump winning 
- Jeb does something incredible embarrassing (asks an audience to 'please clap' lmaooo)
- Then he snowballs backwards. and Trump wins. 

###### 2004 Republican primary

Former governor of Vermont Howard Dean ran a campaign in 2004 to try and unseat incumbent Republican President George W. Bush. After losing the Iowa Caucus to eventual nomination winner John Kerry, Dean have an infamously socially awkward 'rallying cry' to his supporters – the media fallout from this 'Dean Scream' was all that was needed to end his election bid.

### Do invisible primaries play a significant role in US primaries?

| Reduces the number of candidates in the race as candidates drop out.                   | Do they narrow voter choice? | There may be few or no dropouts during this phase.                    | 3rd- the vote would narrow anyway as candidates with little name recognition run out of money.                                                                                      |
| allows a candidate to establish themselves- especially if they are lesser known/funded | Outsiders succeeding         | no actual voting takes place, so they could perform very differently. | 2nd- outsiders succeeding is rare and usually requires money/ cult popularity- but it can still happen, so it's stronger than Choice theme.                                         |
| Gives an indication, and is often proven to be the eventual winner                     | Do they determine the winner | They can't tell us with any certainty.                                | 1st- it very clearly gives- at least- an indication of who will win. In the case of Buttigieg- while he was the IP winner and didn't win overall, his endorsed candidate still won. |
