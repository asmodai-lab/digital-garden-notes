#### Vice-president pick

The vice presidential pick (also known as a 'running mate' before being elected) is also confirmed at the party conference. This can be a big deal because candidates often want to show party unity. The ideal candidate will be:
- someone who is not completely politically aligned with the President
- from a different part of the country to the president, ideally a swing state (or of a specific demographic)
- their strengths are the president's weaknesses

###### Various evidence

- In 2016, Trump's main rival (Ted Cruz) refused to endorse Donald after losing, telling people to 'vote with your conscience.'
	- This led to negative media coverage
- The democratic Convention of 2020 agreed policies based on a Unity Task Force headed by Biden and losing candidate Sanders. 
	- Losing primary candidates Sanders, Warren, Buttigeig and the irrelevant one all endorsed Biden, showing unity.
- In both 2016 and 2020 voters held strong views on the candidates. 
	- In 2020, more voters had a strong opinion regarding Trump than any incumbent since 1980. By May 2020, 69% stated that they had strong opinions on Trump.
		- This suggested fewer swing voters than previous years
	- This, alongside the reduction of conventions due to the pandemic, suggests that conventions have limited impact on the views of voters
		- it is swing voters who swing an election- and Biden held advantage with independents even before the 2020 convention.
