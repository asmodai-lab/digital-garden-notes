**Candidates from the same party compete against each other in a public vote.** In some election years, there are two primaries- one for Democrats and one for Republicans. A voter is allowed to vote in one party's primary only. In other election years, only one party holds a primary. It is unusual for anyone inside the party to challenge a sitting president who plans to run for a second term. 

Different states hold their primaries on different dates. 

Some states choose to hold their primaries on the same day as each other to maximize their influence. *The most significant example of this is known as 'Super Tuesday', in which lots of states hold their primaries on the same day.*

Each state is given a number of 'delegates' reflecting it's population. Delegates are Party activists. They pledge to go to a meeting (the party convention) that takes place after all states have voted. Delegates vote for a specific candidate reflecting how the voters in their state voted. *By winning in a state, a candidate wins delegates (think of them as points) which are added up as candidates compete in more states. In most cases, there is a proportional rule. If a candidate achieves 20% of the vote in a state, they receive 20% of the delegates from that state.

Any candidate who gets over 50% of all delegates wins- they become the official presidential candidate for that party. This is confirmed at the party convention at the end of the voting process. All delegates meet and cast their votes to make the role official.

## What are the different kinds of primaries?

**Open primary**
- a primary that does not require voters to be affiliated with a political party to vote. 
- *Iowa, Hawaii, Wyoming, Idaho*
**Closed primary**
- a primary that requires voters to be registered with a political party to vote in it
- *Alaska for Democrats, Nevada, Michigan, Missouri for Republicans*
**Semi-closed primary**
- voters can choose to participate in either the democratic OR the republican primary
- *New Hampshire, North Carolina*
**Caucus**
- deciding the candidates for primaries with discussion in a meeting. 
- *Hawaii- open, Colorado- closed, Maine- Semi-closed*
- **These can be open, closed, and semi-closed individually**

### Homework questions

**What are the three methods through which delegates can be allocated through primaries and caucuses?**
	*- **Pledged**: pledged delegates are democratic delegates who are required to vote for a specific candidate- the one who won the most votes in the primary, or a caucus. There are three types- district delegates, at-large delegates, and add-on delegates (who represent elected officials or party leaders)*
	*- **Unpledged**: AKA superdelegates. Unique to the Democrats, again.* 
	*- **Bound**: Republican delegates who are just pledged delegates but republican*
	*- **Unbound**: just superdelegates*
1. Proportional- ==For Democrats (they only use this one)== they have a formula for allocating delegates based on the statewide vote in primaries and caucuses. Candidates must receive at least 15% of the vote to get any delegates. Republicans do this too on occasion
2. Winner-take-all: all of a state's delegates available in a contest are allocated to the candidate who receives the majority vote in a state primary or caucus
3. Hybrid- there are many versions, but most common is majority-take-all, where delegates are won proportionally based on the statewide vote. Still, a candidate may win them all if they receive over 50 percent of the vote.

**Which states have the earliest primaries and caucuses and why?**
- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina all have primaries/caucuses in February.
- Iowa starts early because it takes a while to do (caucus)
- New Hampshire starts early because it legally has shotgun (primary)

**What is frontloading, and why does it happen?**
- Frontloading involves individual states moving their primary or caucus day to the front of the presidential primary season calendar
- it happens because snowballing happens. 
	- Biden did it in 2024 to try and help himself gain momentum. 
- OR to make sure your state has more of a say if a candidate has already become presumptive, or the candidate they wanted to vote for ran out of money/confidence/etc and dropped out


**What is Super Tuesday, and what was Super Duper Tuesday?**
- Super Tuesday is the day when the largest number of states hold their primary elections or caucuses simultaneously. Because of the large number of states participating, Super Tuesday has a substantial impact on the allocation of delegates. 
- Super Duper Tuesday was for the 2008 primaries/caucuses- ~20 states participated.

**When did Trump secure a majority of delegates in 2020, and how many states had not voted by that point?**

- he became the presumptive Republican candidate on March 17th, 2020. 
- (the republican convention encouraged other states to use winner-takes-all)
- around 25 states had not voted by the time Trump became presumptive candidate

## Strengths and weaknesses

#### Open Primaries
+> maximizes the choice of voters. anyone can vote in either party's primary. This can be very important in years where only one party has a primary because it allows voters to participate without being registered
+> they can attract more moderate voters.
-> subject to spoiling tactics- Republicans slowing down a democrat candidate, wasting time and resources
-> why are you letting rando's vote. 

#### Closed Primaries

+> prevents spoiling tactics
+> protects the identity (vibe) of a party
-> prevents independents from voting, which could damage electoral chances.
-> unfair in years where only one party holds a primary
