##### What are the five kinds of democracy?

1. direct - the electorate directly votes on issues (referendums)
2. representative- the electorate elects representatives to do government for them (also consider the delegate v trustee method: whether MPs vote based on who voted for them or based on what they think is best- it's based on the **Burke-an principle**- which is part of an address to his constituents in 1776)
3. pluralist- many different groups have a say/ power is shared across society
4. liberal- rights are entrenched in laws/ the constitution- *it's a subtype of representative democracy*
5. proletariat- state is organized by the workers/ the working class

#### How do pressure groups try to influence politicians? 
###### Terminology for US pressure groups
- **Mandate:** when a mandatory regulation is introduced, forcing a product to fulfill a certain criteria (usually safety) (i.e. the state decides what a good product is)
- **Bailout**- when a company (often a bank) has it's debts covered by public funds prevented from going bankrupt
- **Boondoggle**- a government program that may been seen as inefficient. For example, using public funds to create jobs or build infrastructure that the market will not do because it is loss-making, but it makes the business that does it a shitton of money
- **K street**- a major street in Washington DC known for having numerous pressure group HQs
- Revolving door- the idea that people will be hired to write laws, then be hired to get around the laws, then be hired to write new laws to stop people getting around them, ad infinitum
