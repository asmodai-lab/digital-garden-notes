# Politics in the USA

## 1790s-1830s
•The dominant view at this time was that whites were a Herrenvolk – ‘Master folk/race’. This particularly applied to the Anglo-Saxon races of the Germans and English.

•God had created the United States by allowing them to win the War of Independence.

•The white race therefore had the God given right to settle across the continent. This theory was known as ‘Manifest Destiny’.

•The USA was a white country. Non-whites could not be citizens of the Republic. Therefore, they didn’t possess any benefits of being a citizen – namely rights.

•All white men deserved equal rights to one another.

•Native Americans were racially inferior. They could be put onto ‘reservations’, but violent resistance had to be crushed.

•Blacks were inferior to whites. And women were emotional and reliant upon men. They certainly did not have the ability to make political decisions.

## 1830s-1865
•A huge divide opens in the US. It is driven partly by the Industrial Revolution, with the North industrialising and the South relying on exporting cotton (which was worth more than its weight in gold!). The South’s tropical climate allowed this to happen. (Remember Clinton’s criticism of Madison and pressure groups!)

•The North wants to ban slavery, as its being seen as immoral by lots of countries. The British Empire had already begun to ban it from around 1800. Southerners disagree.

•The situation is complicated by the fact that the US is still expanding. Should new states be ‘slave-states’ or ‘free-states’? The issue of slavery is a state rights issue, not a federal issue.

•In the 1850s, the Democratic Party splits over the issue, and a new party forms that is exclusively anti-slavery, called the Republican Party.

White supremacism is still completely normal at this point. People just disagree over whether non-whites deserve to be made citizens of the Republic

•In November 1860, the Republican candidate – Abraham Lincoln – becomes US President but only carries Northern states.

•Southern states secede from the US en masse. They form a new country called the Confederate States of America (CSA).

•The USA invades the CSA. The better USA economy allows it to defeat the CSA in 1865.

•Abraham Lincoln then forces the adoption of the 13th Amendment, banning slavery. It’s know as the ‘Emancipation Amendment’.

•The 15th Amendment made it illegal to stop someone voting because of their race (provided that they were a man…)

## 1865-1940s
•Black People are emancipated in the South and given equal rights. However…

•Southern states hate the Northerns and consider them invaders. The Southern states do everything possible to frustrate the new equal rights laws. A terrorist group called the Klu Klux Klan is set up.

•Segregation is enforced through ‘Jim Crow laws’ (rhymes with something). Legally, Black People should enjoy equality quality public services (eg. schools) to whites, but in practice this does not happen.

•Laws are carefully designed to prevent blacks from voting, such as needing to pass a literacy tests before you can vote.

•The final Native Americans were forced onto reservations by the US Army in the ‘Indian Wars’.

•A female suffrage movement developed after the Civil War and the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote in 1920

## 1940s-1960s
•Opposition to segregation in the South develops through the  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr.

•They win several legal victories, arguing that segregation is racist. They get greater Civil Rights.

•However, there is extreme violence in the South and some other cities. Racism remains deeply culturally imbedded. The terrorist Klu Klux Klan re-emerges. 

•President Johnson (Dem) supports the Civil Rights Act in 1964. Democratic support plummets in the Southern states and it switches to the Republicans. The South had been known as the ‘Solid South’ for Democrats.

## 1960s-2000s
Bussing orders school districts to bus white children to schools in majority black areas. It began in the 1960s, but faded away in the 1980 s due to opposition from whites in the South.

•An argument develops that says that changing rights only gives equality of opportunity. What was really needed was equality of ‘results’ (meaning ‘equality of outcome’).

•A movement calling for affirmative action forms. Affirmative action means positive discrimination – where members of minority groups are given advantages over majority groups (eg. Easier access to university). The goal it to make minority groups wealthier.

•Furthermore, integration (opposed to segregation) is imposed on Southern states by the federal government.

•A feminist movement also develops in the 1960s – although the Equal Rights Amendment fails to adopted, despite being passed in Congress and being signed by President Carter.

•An LGBT rights amendment develops. Harvey Milk becomes the first openly gay official in California, but is murdered in 1978. Homosexual acts between men are legalised by the Supreme Court in southern states in 2003.

## 2000s-
•Affirmative action has been increasingly criticised. Several Supreme Court rulings have found against affirmative action projects since 2003.

•LGBT rights have improved – The US military policy of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t tell’ was removed in 2011, and same-sex marriage legalised in 2015 by a Supreme Court ruling.

•The # MeToo movement against sexual assault has developed since 2017.

•President Obama worked to allow easier access for refugees to the USA.

•The white supremacy movement has begun to grow since 2016. Violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters broke out in Charlottesville in 2017. Hostility to immigration and Islamophobia has also grown.




# What is immigration like today?

Key things to remember (cultural differences)

•The USA is ‘a nation of immigrants’. Many Americans’ identity comes from having dual heritage (eg. Italian-American; Irish-American). This is partly due to a belief in the American Dream – any hardworking, morally good person can become wealthy – that attracted immigrants

•The USA has become increasingly intolerant to Hispanic people and Muslims, due partly to the War on Drugs (starting in the 1970s), the War on Terror (2001) and a big dollop of bigotry – possibly due the insular nature of rural American communities and existing racial politics.

•De-industrialisation since the 1980s has created the Rust Belt. Immigrants can be perceived as threats to the security of semi and unskilled labourers. (Feeling keen? Look up the Modernisation Loser Thesis!)


Totals:
	- as of 2023, 27% of the US population are either immigrants or the children of immigrants. That's about 90 million people
	- around 3/4 of those are in the US legally. Hence, it is estimated that there are around 22 million illegal immigrants or children of illegal immigrants.
- The US has the largest immigrant population of any country in the world
- The figures in 2024:
	- around 1 million people legally migrated to the USA
	- it is estimated that about 3 million illegally migrated.
Note that the term undocumented and illegal are different but have a big overlap. Undocumented is mostly children of illegal immigrants. 
## Why is illegal immigration so high?
- in the 1940s, the US allowed large numbers of guest workers from Mexico. They could stay to work briefly- often coming as seasonable labour. However, this was ended in 1964. Thus, many people chose to make a one-way trip
	- part of the problem is that the people would come and go seasonally- so many chose to go and not leave. 
- There was exceptional instability in Latin America in recent years- notably in Mexico and Venezuela
- A law called **Title 42** was used to expel new arrivals during COVID to protect the population from disease. Some people were expelled several times- but that was counted as individual people, inflating the statistics.
### What has illegal immigration been like since the 1970s
- border encounters by the Border Guard are used as a broad estimation to gauge the number of illegal migrants
- numbers wa
There was a gradual increase form 1970-2000, a reduction

## How have US presidents responded?
- in the eighties and nineties, both Reagan and Clinton deployed more border agents and introduced harsher penalties for illegal migration. However, this encouraged even less seasonal migration
In 1986, the **Immigration reform and control act** is introduced.
	 Makes it illegal to hire undocumented migrants
	 but grants amnesty to 3 million migrants, and also does an executive order to give that to children of undocumented migrants' children
From 2000-2016
- the Mexican
- birth rate dropped, leading to fewer youths trying to cross
- George Bush:
	-  Deployed more border guards, citing 9/11
	- introduced 'secure communities' in 2008, meaning that anyone arrested automatically had their migration status checked
- Barack Obama
	- makes it easier to get visas for seasonal work
	- tried to introduce the **DREAM act**, making it so kids who came in illegally can work (although they can't be here forever)
		- this is EXACTLY what George Bush tried to introduce. It failed due to a republican filibuster
	- in 2012, he puts out a memorandum **(DACA)** instructed the federal police to not apprehend undocumented immigrants who arrived as minors
		- in 2014, he expands this to **DAPA**, which applies it to parents too
			- This gets blocked by the supreme court in 2016
	- He maximises 'temporary protected status' which means that some migrants (from countries/minorities) and gives a lot of them out
		- He had a record number of deportations. He deports more than Trump in his first term.
- Trump (first term):
	- he says he is going to build a wall
		- he only succeeds in building a fifth of it
		- he says he'll make Mexico pay by putting tariffs. he is stupid
	- He tries to phase out DACA but this is blocked by district courts
	- in the summer of 2017, Trump orders the **Family-separation policy**. Children of undocumented migrants are taken from their parents and put in care homes and the parents are deported/put in jail

# Essay planning

•How many Americans have been affected?

•Does one point cause/directly-affect other points?

•If each point was individually ‘rubbed out’ of history, which one would change the USA the most?
