### Various other points
- the court can only hear 60-200 cases each year, it rejects thousands of cases, letting lower court's decisions stand
	- i.e. it does not overly involve itself
- The Supreme court often sides with federalism. 
- It continually steps into public policy.
- The opportunity to check the supreme court is more difficult due to life tenure
- Trump appointed 3 justices, which have helped uphold many of his decisions.
- It clearly has the power to reinterpret long-established precents. 
- The supreme court tends to not uphold privacy rights- especially for immigrants, despite it being in the bill of rights. 
- It does uphold rights of groups not included in the constitution (==Living constitution theory==)
- it tends to reinforce due process, notably for immigrants
- - recently (2025) courts blocked Trump's orders to send troops to Chicago, and he sent other troops.
