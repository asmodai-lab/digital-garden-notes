## Judicial branch powers
#### Appointing justices
- the president can nominate Supreme Court justices to the Supreme Court. 
- this does, however, require senate confirmation
	- Biden nominated Ketanji Brown-Jackson in 2022
	- Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh in 2018- which got through, despite his controversial history
		- Obama tried to nominate Merrick Garland right before the 2016 election- but the senate, under direction of Bitch McConnell, ignored it. 
		- Amy Coney Barrett was put through in September 2020, though- but we already knew that Trump has no honor. 
- all justices from Trump were put through. 
#### Power of pardon
- in 2022, Biden pardoned thousands of individuals for simple possession of Marijuana- acknowledging how a federal charge can make finding housing and jobs easier, despite no harsh crime being committed.
- in January 2025, Trump pardoned 1500 January 6th rioters, despite it being incredibly controversial
