The executive office of the presidency. (This is why it's called the presiden*cy*: because there is many people in it.)

*Related to [[Politics/02 - USA/The presidency/Vice-president and cabinet\|Vice-president and cabinet]]*
#### Random notes 

- It's made up of about 30 different offices and departments. 
- it started off as advisors to the president
	- they are established to help the president make decisions and carry out their policies. 
- Important ones to know
	- ==the national security council
	- ==the office of management and budget
	- ==white house office
- FYI- you can't scrutinize them because they aren't elected. (*some members get scrutiny, but it's significantly less than cabinet*)
	- EXOP aren't talked about at all in the **constitution**. They are used much more than the cabinet because it's better to give a job to an agency which gets less scrutiny- so cabinet becomes useless. 
==Susie Wiles==: White house chief of staff. Could be called the second most powerful person in the US. 
- the problem is that EXOP can conflict with cabinet because they are doing the same job- so they do the same job twice (which is not good)
Initially, FDR sets up EXOP to help deal with the great depression, because he was building all this shit and needs to get it right. It is initially quite small. **Now** it has ~1,800 employees
- the budget is voted for by congress. 


## Franklin Delanore Roosevelt

Franklin D. Roosevelt became president in 1933- right in the middle of the great depression (which was caused by the wall street crash.)
- he sets up lots of new organizations to help deal with it- called are 
- the ==alphabet agencies
	- this is called **New Federalism**
- trying to set up all these agencies is hard work, because Roosevelt lacks the staff around him. 
- there were already ~100 government agencies rattling around- and it is a hugely disorganized mess. 
- many of the departments and government agencies are very independent


###### *Why does EXOP exist?*

- FDR establishes a committee to make recommendations
	- all the loose agencies get merged into the 12 departments
	- a new set of agencies are set up that are just staff to help the president. 
- initially, it has around 600 staff in two agencies
- this then steadily expands during the cold war to 2-3000 people
- by 1993, it has a budget of $194 million
- this peaks in 2005, at $7.6 billion, mostly due to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
	- the budget is currently ~$1 billion

## What are the problems with EXOP? 

##### Weak checks and balances from congress
- around 25 people must face senate confirmation from a staff of ~4,000
- some areas of EXOP have scrutiny from Congressional Committees, but many who do not- particularly the WHO. 
	- (the white house office has no scrutiny in the slightest.)


#### Weak checks and balances from the judiciary
- 'privilege' is a legal right that we sometimes have to not turn over information to courts. For example, e-mails between you and your lawyer when preparing your cases
- 'executive privilege' exists in the US. it applies when turning over information would impair the functioning of the government. 
	- this clearly sometimes applies- like when people are on terrorist lists
	- but sometimes it's used to hide things- like Nixon with Watergate, or Trump with the Epstein list. 

#### Falling out with other departments
- sometimes the goals or methods of EXOP simply don't align with those of the Federal Departments (the ones led by cabinet officers)
- EXOP often gets projects that Departments don't get
