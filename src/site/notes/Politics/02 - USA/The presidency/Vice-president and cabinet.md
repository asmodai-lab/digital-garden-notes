How much do the Vice-president of the USA and president matter? 

The vice-president is a role that is elastic in terms of it's power. It is principally ceremonial- but the president can give the vice more power. 
- constitutionally speaking, the VP only has two powers
	- to case the deciding vote of a tie in the senate
	- to take on the roles/duties of the president if the president is unable to, i.e.: 
		- the president is dead
		- the president is undergoing surgery (Harris for 84 minutes during Biden's)
		- the president is incommunicado (during 9/11, Bush had bad WIFI for the start. Dick Cheney ordered one of the planes to be shot down, but it had been taken over by a passenger rebellion so unnecessary.)
- informal powers of the VP
	- Dick Cheney (Bush's VP) was given considerable power over energy and defense policy. 
	- Harris was a border 'tsar'
- they can be quite important in terms of the image of the white house
	- for Harris, it was Biden appearing progressive
	- J.D Vance shows a connection to white, working-class voters and veterans. 
	- Biden (under Obama) was a sign of competence and experience besides the relatively youthful Obama. 
	- Mike Pence represented the Christian right-wing
	- Harry Truman under FDR was very apprehensive about having good relations with the USSR. This was significant because he succeeded FDR. 

What is the purpose of the US Cabinet?
- the cabinet has no constitutional power EXCEPT under the 25th amendment
	- the 25th amendment gives the cabinet the power to remove the president- based on a majority vote- if they feel that the president is literally unable to carry out their duties
- otherwise, the cabinet is an advisory body only. 
- > they are called cabinet officers, not ministers
- MOST of them are the head of a federal government department. 
	- There are currently 15. Also trump recently (5/09/25) renamed the department of defense to war
- some are heads of other agencies, like the CIA
	- all **but** three of them require senate confirmation, and they can also be impeached by congress
- for each new federal government department to be created or abolished, an act of Congress must be passed
- they are usually policy experts, not previously in politics. 
It meets quite rarely. Joe Biden only held 9 cabinet meetings. 
Sometimes people will attend meetings whilst not being formal cabinet officers (i.e. Musk)
