### To what extent can the president dominate congress in domestic policy?

| President can choose when to adjourn congress. Trump threatened to do so in 2020 to get his nominees through. | convening congress    | Realistically, it doesn't happen that much- because it's only if both houses can't agree to a recess date. |
Evaluation: Overall, the President dominates congress in domestic policy to a large extent- because although congress does have methods of overruling presidential power (overriding the presidential veto, and passing bills which the president cannot ignore) both take such a significant coordination that being able to perform both- especially in such a partisan political system- is extremely unrealistic for it to occur, and therefore makes congress have little ability to check the executive- whilst the president has many ways of checking the legislature.
