## John Locke

### Historical context of John Locke

Summer 1683, Charles II has been king for more than 20 years. Locke doesn't like Charlie boy — he is also somewhat linked to a plot to kill the king. He moves to the Netherlands to avoid capture.

Locke was very important to British politics. He was an apprentice to the Earl of Shaftsbury, who was basically a radical Marxist.
- he believed that Parliament should meet a bit more often
- he thinks the king should have a bit less power

There is only one thing that Locke hates more than the King: Catholics. Locke worries about the growing influence of Catholicism in England — when James comes in, he is a lot harsher on protestants. Locke is annoyed by this. He decides to come up with a system where people of different religions don't try to kill each other.

Locke tries to do a lot of philosophy.

Then in 1689, James gets overthrown and the new rulers are more tolerant. 

He comes back to England to write 3 books; two of which he didn't put his name on, because they were so radical.
>He theorised that monarchs punishing people for different beliefs is ineffective at changing their beliefs, so people should be allowed to believe what they want to believe and people tolerate that. 
>- Also, whenever certain beliefs are banned, violence happens. 

Locke is literally just the original 'power of friendship' guy.

He writes another book on the Monarch.
>He said that the Divine Right of Kings (King has to do whatever they want or God will be angry at you) is... bad.
>He says that people should be able to choose their leaders. He says that if the ruler breaks the people's trust, the people should be able to overthrow them. This is literally the foundation of democracy.

Although, keep in mind he still hated Catholics (because they were sworn to one ruler — the Pope), and didn't count Atheists. He also invested some money in the slave trade. 

**These ideas are the foundation of Liberalism.**
- rights
- tolerance
- freedom
- democracy
- equality of opportunity
- limited government
- rule of law

## Core ideas of Liberalism

### Individualism
The idea that individuals are capable of making decisions for themselves, as opposed to requiring their 'betters' to do that on their behalf.

Individuals are self-interested, rather than being concerned about wider society. However, as individuals do not exist in a vacuum, liberalism argues for tolerance of others, particularly of their political and religious views. If someone is not causing you harm, they should be allowed to continue their business. 
>It's just 'treat others how you wish to be treated.'

#### The change in understanding of tolerance

The understanding of tolerance has evolved. Mary Wollstonecraft argued to extend tolerance to women, particularly in the case of the right to vote. In the 20th century, Betty Friedan continued this, arguing for full equality for women.
- Over time, different groups have been the focus of debates around tolerance. 
	- In the UK, this has included allowing Catholics and Jews to sit in Parliament, tolerance towards migrants, homosexuality, and now transgender people.

#### Liberal denominations
Whilst all liberals support the argument that the individual is more important than any collective group, modern and classical liberals have different ideas on what liberals can achieve in isolation.
- Classical liberals support **'egoistic individualism'**
	- that is the belief that humans are rational, and therefore self-interested, therefore self-reliant and capable of thriving on their own.
	- society is atomistic — we are all of the atoms: separate.
- Modern liberals are critical of this concept, supporting **'developmental individualism',** noting that personal circumstances play a big role in an individual's ability to thrive in isolation. These situations mostly refer to inequalities — such as in race, class, and gender.
	- Whilst liberals argue in favour of a tolerant, fair society, they cannot control other's social attitudes.
>Consequently, modern liberals (such as John Rawls) argue that if humans are left to their own devices, inequalities will get worse. Therefore, the role of the state is to help individuals develop and thrive through opportunities.

### Freedom/liberty
For liberals, freedom is not granted by a ruler or government, it is a natural right that humans have by virtue of being human. The state's role is to uphold this freedom by preventing harm to individuals that would impact their liberty, and to enforce contracts that individuals freely enter into with each other.
- Locke described this role as vital for ensuring people were free.
	- 'where there is no law, there is no liberty'

The state only exists by consent of the governed, which is also known as the social contract — which Locke believes that humans enter into willingly to help ensure that there is an arbitrator to uphold the freedom of individuals.

Locke says that when a government ceases to promote freedom, the people have the right to withdraw their consent to be governed and replace the government.
