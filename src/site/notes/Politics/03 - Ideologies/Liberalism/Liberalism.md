## John Locke

### Historical context of John Locke
---
Summer 1683, Charles II has been king for more than 20 years. Locke doesn't like Charlie boy — he is also somewhat linked to a plot to kill the king. He moves to the Netherlands to avoid capture.

Locke was very important to British politics. He was an apprentice to the Earl of Shaftsbury, who was basically a radical Marxist.
- he believed that Parliament should meet a bit more often
- he thinks the king should have a bit less power

There is only one thing that Locke hates more than the King: Catholics. Locke worries about the growing influence of Catholicism in England — when James comes in, he is a lot harsher on protestants. Locke is annoyed by this. He decides to come up with a system where people of different religions don't try to kill each other.

Locke tries to do a lot of philosophy.

Then in 1689, James gets overthrown and the new rulers are more tolerant. 

He comes back to England to write 3 books; two of which he didn't put his name on, because they were so radical.
>He theorised that monarchs punishing people for different beliefs is ineffective at changing their beliefs, so people should be allowed to believe what they want to believe and people tolerate that. 
>- Also, whenever certain beliefs are banned, violence happens. 

Locke is literally just the original 'power of friendship' guy.

He writes another book on the Monarch.
>He said that the Divine Right of Kings (King has to do whatever they want or God will be angry at you) is... bad.
>He says that people should be able to choose their leaders. He says that if the ruler breaks the people's trust, the people should be able to overthrow them. This is literally the foundation of democracy.

Although, keep in mind he still hated Catholics (because they were sworn to one ruler — the Pope), and didn't count Atheists. He also invested some money in the slave trade. 

**These ideas are the foundation of Liberalism.**
- rights
- tolerance
- freedom
- democracy
- equality of opportunity
- limited government
- rule of law

## Core ideas of Liberalism
---
### Individualism
---
The idea that individuals are capable of making decisions for themselves, as opposed to requiring their 'betters' to do that on their behalf.

Individuals are self-interested, rather than being concerned about wider society. However, as individuals do not exist in a vacuum, liberalism argues for tolerance of others, particularly of their political and religious views. If someone is not causing you harm, they should be allowed to continue their business. 
>It's just 'treat others how you wish to be treated.'

#### The change in understanding of tolerance

The understanding of tolerance has evolved. Mary Wollstonecraft argued to extend tolerance to women, particularly in the case of the right to vote. In the 20th century, Betty Friedan continued this, arguing for full equality for women.
- Over time, different groups have been the focus of debates around tolerance. 
	- In the UK, this has included allowing Catholics and Jews to sit in Parliament, tolerance towards migrants, homosexuality, and now transgender people.

#### Liberal denominations
Whilst all liberals support the argument that the individual is more important than any collective group, modern and classical liberals have different ideas on what liberals can achieve in isolation.
- Classical liberals support **'egoistic individualism'**
	- that is the belief that humans are rational, and therefore self-interested, therefore self-reliant and capable of thriving on their own.
	- society is atomistic — we are all of the atoms: separate.
- Modern liberals are critical of this concept, supporting **'developmental individualism',** noting that personal circumstances play a big role in an individual's ability to thrive in isolation. These situations mostly refer to inequalities — such as in race, class, and gender.
	- Whilst liberals argue in favour of a tolerant, fair society, they cannot control other's social attitudes.
>Consequently, modern liberals (such as John Rawls) argue that if humans are left to their own devices, inequalities will get worse. Therefore, the role of the state is to help individuals develop and thrive through opportunities.

### Freedom/liberty
---
For liberals, freedom is not granted by a ruler or government, it is a natural right that humans have by virtue of being human. The state's role is to uphold this freedom by preventing harm to individuals that would impact their liberty, and to enforce contracts that individuals freely enter into with each other.
- Locke described this role as vital for ensuring people were free.
	- 'where there is no law, there is no liberty'
	- this concept antithetical to the idea of [Negative freedom](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/)
		- *"Negative liberty is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints."* (i.e. the govt. should leave you alone.)

The state only exists by consent of the governed, which is also known as the social contract — which Locke believes that humans enter into willingly to help ensure that there is an arbitrator to uphold the freedom of individuals.

Locke says that when a government ceases to promote freedom, the people have the right to withdraw their consent to be governed and replace the government. 

### State
---
The more you are left alone, the freer you are. 
- But without a state, bad things will happen. 
- But if the state is too big, bad things will happen.
> The state needs to exist in order to enforce the laws so that people can be free, but also as small as possible so the state can't infringe on anybody's rights.
> > the state is a 'necessary evil'
> > > This is called a 'Nightwatchman State' (Locke invented this)

So, the state's job is:
- protect us from each other
- protect us from foreign countries
- enforce contracts

The government exists by the consent of the people via a 'social contract.' People would be more willing to obey a government whose authority is limited, is elected by the people, and which is restricted in it's ability to restrict rights via a **constitution**.

#### Modern liberalism and the state

Some liberals have adopted a more positive view of the state — because of the potential good a state can do to allow human flourishing: aka an '**enabling state**'.

>[!EXAMPLE] Case study
>Around the start of the 20th century, it was clear that many in industrial Britain were caught in a 'poverty trap' — forced to work for low pay that could barely cover rent, without any means to retire or miss work because of illness. Children were also caught in this, and so they were unable to be educated and therefore broaden their prospects.
>
>As such, modern liberals questioned whether there was genuine equality of opportunity, and whether it was fair to assume those in poverty earned it through idleness.
>>so, modern liberals called for the state to ensure genuine freedom of opportunity, and a safety net (pensions/national insurance for unemployment/welfare/benefits) for those struggling
>>>these ideas are connected to [Keynesian economic theory](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2014/09/basics.htm) and John Stuart Mill
>


### Rationalism
---
>[!INFO]
>Everyone is a rational person, so they are capable of making the best decisions for themselves.

This is rationalism, which - for classical liberals - is the foundation of personal freedom **and** means that the government should intervene as minimally as possible
- Thinkers here are John Locke and [[Politics/03 - Ideologies/Liberalism/Liberalism#Adam Smith\|Adam Smith]]
	- they argue that individuals, guided by reason, can identify their own interests and act in ways that promote societal progress
So therefore, we have some rights that should never be infringed
- the right to life is the most important one
	- they are split on right to an abortion / right to death
Some also argued that this idea advocates for laissez-faire capitalism, the main proponent being

#### Adam Smith

Adam Smith had this idea called **the invisible hand of the market**:
- Because people are rational, this means that their actions collectively create wealth and efficiency
	- i.e. the market works because everyone is acting well within the market.
> This is the classical liberal idea about the economy, which is completely different from [[Politics/03 - Ideologies/Liberalism/Liberalism#Modern liberalism\|Modern liberal's ideas about the state.]]
