You have 4 major socialist ideas. 

The spec only asks for three

[[Politics/03 - Ideologies/Socialism/Revolutionary Socialism\|Revolutionary Socialism]] — also known as Marxism

[[Politics/03 - Ideologies/Socialism/Democratic Socialism\|Democratic Socialism]] — the one that you can't talk about in essays. Don't do it.
