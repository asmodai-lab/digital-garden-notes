You have 4 major socialist ideas. 

The spec only asks for three. DON'T WRITE ABOUT THE FOURTH ONE (Democratic Socialism)

> There is quite a wide range between Revolutionary Socialism and the Third way. Think of it like pure squash and water with a drop of squash.


In the 1800s, there are a shitton of revolutions. This is considered the origin of socialism.

In 1848, Marx publishes the communist manifesto whilst with his friend, Friedrich Engels.

Democratic Socialism is Marxism without the violence. (**This is the one that you can't talk about in the exam**)
- Beatrice & Sidney Webb (they found the Fabian society which is still *very* involved with the labour party)
	- these are two of our key thinkers

Social Democracy is a compromise between socialism and capitalism. 

The third way is Tony fucking Blair. 

# Marxism

## Important distinction

We learn about Marx's ideas, not how they were carried out. 

The exam board does not consider soviet communism to be communism. 

| Marx                                                             | Soviet Communism                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Popular today in universities and some very radical trade unions | seen in the eastern bloc                |
|                                                                  | criticised for corrupting Marxist ideas |

## Marx's view of history

### Pre-revolution phase
Always involves two classes- two economic groups. Today, it's the capitalists and the workers. Marx says that there is a constant cycle of creating new economic systems which still uphold oppression. Marx says that capitalism will be the last of these before communism. 

He uses an idea of Hegel- *dialectical change*- he says that the way that ideas develop is by a <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">thesis</span> and an <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">antithesis</span> challenging each other, which then<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> creates a synthesis. </span>
	Marx got taught by<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> Hegel</span>. He steals the idea and calls it *dialectical/historical materialism*- the same idea but the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">theses and antitheses are economic systems. </span>
		this is why<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> Marxists are</span> atheists- because they are<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> materialists. </span>
	It's <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">materialism (empiricism) and rationalism</span> (idealism- like belief in God or the soul)
![synthesis.png|800](/img/user/Images/synthesis.png)

Marx says that every society is<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> underpinned by oppression. </span>
	*"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles."*
For Capitalism, there are two classes; the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Bourgeoisie</span> and the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> Proletariat.</span>
	 The Bourgeoisie are those who own Capital (the means of production) or Land (the resources of production)

#### Nature of society
Marx talks about the nature of society- that being the substructure (the economic system) and the superstructure (which is both a product the substructure and what helps keep it in place)
	 The superstructure includes education, police, religion, nationalism, media, and the legal system. 
		 the legal system enforces private ownership
		 religion can enforce that things are individually your fault/god's will
		 the police enforce the legal system
		 nationalism means that people don't think that their problems are caused by the upper class, but by people of other countries
			 He calls this false consciousness
![Substructure.png](/img/user/Images/Substructure.png)

#### Nature of capitalism
Marx believes that capitalism will inevitably collapse.
- there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world.
	- the rich can only get richer if the poor get poorer/ same thing with power
	- (technically this is untrue)
- to earn more profits, capitalists cut wages. this happens across the economy
- but workers need money to buy the capitalist's goods- so some capitalist companies go bankrupt when wages are too low.
- then the bankrupt capitalist joins the working class
- the capitalists then become a smaller and smaller class. 

##### Marx's theory of alienation
Also, workers become **alienated** from their humanity, because they never create product from start to finish (which is vital to humanity). This is because capitalism encourages specialisation. Workers become depressed- this is akin to being a prisoner.

### Revolutionary phase
The oppressed class will eventually realise that they are being oppressed as a group, and they will gain *class conciousness.*

> [!tip] Context for Marx's time
> When Marx is writing in the 1840 s, the majority of people don't have a right to vote.

**The phases of the revolution**

1. The workers spontaneously rise up against the capitalists
		Note that Marxists do hate Social Democrats, because they are compliant in the system, but they pretend to be on the side of Socialism.
2. Workers seize control of the factories and establish *democratic workers' councils.*
3. The state is seized. The state becomes a dictatorship of the proletariat — a workers' democracy where capitalists are prevented from having political power. 
		A 'dictatorship' of the proletariat is not a traditional dictatorship, it's a dictatorship because the capitalists are locked out.
Because everything is collectively owned, there is no bourgeoisie class. Therefore, there is only one class, and there is a classless society.

The state performs two functions:
- To<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> 'protect the gains of the revolution'</span> — to fight against<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> internal enemies</span> (bourgeoisie) who could lead a <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">counterrevolution.</span>
- To <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">prevent external threats</span>: invasion of nearby capitalist countries — which could also be fascists.
	-<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> Anarchists</span> think that the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> state</span> should be<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> gone cold turkey</span>
- To create a <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">'planned economy', </span>where <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">every industry</span> is<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> nationalized</span>, and<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> decisions</span> about the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> economy</span> are made<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> centrally.</span>

### Communists utopia
Marx believed that this was inevitable, 95% of what he writes is about the pre-revolutionary phase. 

> 1. The post-revolutionary phase happens once the whole world has become communist
> 2. Everyone will live in communes of about 200 people (hence the term communism)
> 3. There will be de-urbanization 
> 	because cities are a product of capitalism
> 4. There is no need for a state. 
> 	The state will 'wither away' according to Marx
> 5. Human nature will completely change.
> 	Under capitalism, humans are selfish, competitive and materialistic, because those traits are encouraged by the superstructure.
> 		With a new superstructure, human nature will change and become flawless.

> [!summary] —
> "From each according to their ability, to each according to their need."

## Historical context



### Was capitalism changing?
- Marx predicted that over time, wealth would concentrate into the hands of a smaller and smaller bourgeoisie.
	- However, this guy called Eduard Bernstein argued that this wasn't happening
- By the 1980s, Bernstein argued that capitalism was spreading wealth, not concentrating it. 
- This was because of
