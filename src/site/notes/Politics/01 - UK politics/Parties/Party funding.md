## How do parties fund election and campaign expenses?

- in the UK, parties rely a lot on private funding
	- this is very controversial
- they do have limited access to public funds to <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">subsidize policy development</span> and <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">parliamentary security</span>
- policy development grants allocate<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)"> £2 million</span> to all <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">main parties</span> so that they can <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">employ political advisors. </span>
- <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Short money</span> is allocated to <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">opposition parties</span> in the HoC <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">based</span> on the <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">number of seats</span> they have

These<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"> don’t</span> cover campaign and election expenses. For those, the party relies on member subscriptions and individual donations from benefactors. The conservative party has traditionally received large donations from big businesses that see a tory government as being in their best interests.

> In 2019, despite the Brexit Party spending £4,150,000 (13.5% of total spending), it won no seats. The Scottish National Party received £24,929 in donations (0.1% of total spending) and won 48 seats. This suggests that the disproportionate financial influence between political parties has little impact in terms of electoral success.

## Conclusion and debate


> [!tip] A* tip
> Whilst Labour were traditionally more reliant on trade unions for donations, more centrist leaders (Starmer and Blair) have sought support from businesses. They tried to assure business leaders that their policies will not harm industry. In the 2024 general election, Labour got donations from hedge fund managers, tech investors, etc.
