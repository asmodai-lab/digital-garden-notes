## Do minor parties play in important role in UK politics?

| they have an increasing share of the vote. 46 MPs in 2024. The SNP (as third largest) got guaranteed questions in PMQs | Established parties still dominate seat share — winning 90% of MPs in 2024. The lib-dems have greater power but nobody else does. <br>Only MPs from established parties can chair select committees.                                                                                       |

| Devolution means that minor parties play a bigger role (SNP in scotland)                                               | Parliament is still sovereign — so the parties that dominate it are the only ones which matter. <br>>The UK government ignored the Sewel convention when passing the Internal markets act 2020.<br>>N. Ireland decisions have been taken over by Westminster during political instability. |
