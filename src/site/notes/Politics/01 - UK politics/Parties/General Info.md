| • Consensus politics means that there<br>are many philosophical and policy<br>similarities between the main political<br>parties. The opposition may therefore<br>be able to support some government<br>policies<br>• In the 1950s the shared commitment of<br>the Labour chancellor of the exchequer,<br>Hugh Gaitskell, and the Conservative<br>chancellor of the exchequer, R.A.<br>Butler, to full employment and a mixed<br>economy led to the invention of the term<br>‘Butskellism’<br>• Tony Blair embraced traditionally<br>Conservative principles such as the free<br>market and low taxation during his time<br>as Labour leader (1994–2007) | • When politics is adversary, this means<br>that the main parties are divided by<br>fundamental philosophical and policy<br>differences<br>• The opposition will routinely oppose<br>the policies of the government since<br>they are so ideologically and practically<br>opposed to them<br>• The early 1980s provides a good<br>example of adversary politics since<br>the socialism of Labour leader Michael<br>Foot (1980–83) was fundamentally at<br>odds with the free-market reforms of<br>Margaret Thatcher. As Labour leader,<br>Jeremy Corbyn (2015–20) pursued<br>socialist policies that placed Labour in<br>direct conflict with the Conservative<br>Party |
