**The spec asks us to know:**
 - How different pressure groups exert influence and how their methods and influence vary in contemporary politics.
- Case studies of two different pressure groups, highlighting examples of how their methods and influence vary.
- Other collective organisations and groups including think tanks, lobbyists and corporations, and their influence on Government and Parliament

A key part of UK democracy is pressure groups. The definition of pressure groups is quite wide- basically any organized group which is **not** the government working to influence government policy counts- which does lowkey make the opposition political parties count. But don't include that in an essay, it's a bit cheeky. 

# Types of pressure groups


|          | Promotional                         | Sectional                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Insider  | Confederation of British Industry   | Trade unions (with Labour) |
| Outsider | Just Stop Oil, Extinction rebellion | National education Union   |

## Lobbying

Lobbying Act (2014)-
- created a register of lobbyists. Anyone who meets the statutory definition of lobbying must sign register and account for their lobbying activities
	- their definition is "contacting a UK government minister or permanent secretary (or equivalents) on behalf of a third party, in return for payment."
This means that the register is only applicable to individuals or firms lobbying on behalf of a third party- meaning companies with in-house lobbyists (generally the most powerful) are largely unaffected. 
- an estimated only 4% of lobbyists were actually on the register. 
	- In addition to this, there are rules of what lobbying roles former Ministers and Civil Servants can take. There are time limits in place to prevent Ministers and Senior Civil Servants from becoming lobbyists straight away. This is to try to limit the ‘revolving door’ problem.

### Statistics
- the annual spend on lobbying in the UK is estimated to be £2 billion
- it is estimated that 4,000 people work in the lobbying industry
- 8/10 are from FTSE 100 companies

## David Cameron and the Greensill scandal 

Former PM David Cameron- upon leaving the position became a paid advisor to Greensill Capital, a company owned by a guy who had previously been an advisor to him. He received a salary and significant shares in the company.

In 2020, Cameron attempted to persuade government ministers to allow Greensill onto the list of companies getting Government insured loans. He contacted them over 45 times in the span of 3 months. 

Cameron did not break the Lobbying Act (that he had introduced) because he did not technically count as a lobbyist because he was employed directly by Greensill.

He also had extraordinary influence as a former PM- and he used it for financial gain.
