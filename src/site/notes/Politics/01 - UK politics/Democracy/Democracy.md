There are different types of democracy. The general definition is 'ruled by the people'- so not actually very specific. 

The UK is a constitutional monarchy- as is France and Spain. It is kind of irrelevant, since the king has almost no power. 

Because democracy can be quite literally almost anything- it is wise to define the terms in your essays. 

Typically, questions will involve how we can 'better' democracy. This will usually include:
- increasing participation (therefore increasing legitimacy) (this can include discussion of non-voting participation in [[Politics/01 - UK politics/Democracy/Pressure groups, Lobbyists and think tanks\|Pressure groups, Lobbyists and think tanks]])
- increasing legitimacy of the mandate
- increasing the size of [[Politics/01 - UK politics/Democracy/The Franchise\|The Franchise]]
- subjective qualities- such as:
-> strength of government
-> increased protection of rights (which can be incredibly subjective)
-> increasing the dignity of politics (i.e. not letting immoral acts go unpunished)


**Methods of democracy:** 

- Direct democracy: the electorate decides on policy without representatives
- Pluralist democracy: multiple groups, not the people as a whole, can govern, direct and manage society.
- Representative democracy:
- citizens vote for representatives to decide policy
- Liberal democracy- rights and freedoms are officially recognized and protected; excessive political power is limited by the rule of law
- Proletariat democracy- peasants/ industrial workers are in charge of society
