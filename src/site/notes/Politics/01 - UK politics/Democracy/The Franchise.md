The franchise is the group of people in any country who are given the right to vote. The franchise has changed greatly over time, and is greatly contested. 

In 1832, the Great Reform Act was passed.  This extended the franchise to middle-income male voters over the age of 21. Women with property over the age of 30 were given the right to vote in 1918. In 1928, women were given the same voting rights as men (21 and over). In the 1960s, the voting age was lowered to 18 for both men and women.
