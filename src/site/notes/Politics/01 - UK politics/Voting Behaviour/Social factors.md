## Class
### Socio-economic class
This refers to the categorisation of people based on income, occupation, and social status. Traditionally, these have been working, middle, and upper class. However, nowadays it is much more complicated.

In the UK, classes are now grouped as:
1. AB: Higher managerial/professional roles
2. C1: lower managerial/professional roles
3. C2: skilled manual workers
4. DE: semi-skilled and unskilled workers, unemployed, or retired
Obviously, the job descriptions for all of these can be very inaccurate when determining class. It's a generalist approach, not a 100% correct one. 

Socio-economic class historically played a large role in voting behaviour. The commonly held views on how class affects voting behaviour are as follows:
- Labour appeals to C2DE voters because it appeals to the working class by funding a welfare state and supporting worker's rights
- Conservatives appeal to ABC1 voters because their policies favour low taxes and businesses
Nowadays, these assumptions aren't really correct for multiple reasons.

### Factors associated with class alignment of voters

| Class identification       | a.k.a class conciousness — how one's sense of belonging to a class can influence voting behaviour.                 | In 2019, some working-class Leave/Labour voters felt neglected by Labour, contributing to Tory gain.                                                                                          | Class identification has weakened due to broader societal changes, including globalisation (hard to think you're doing crap when you see mass genocide/starvation.)                                                |
| Class dealignment          | refers to weakening of traditional associations between class and party — leading to greater electoral volatility. | In 2019, Tories attracted C2 voters by focusing on Brexit. In 2024, Labour attracted Tory-leaning middle-class voters because of economic dissatisfaction transcending class identity.        | While it provides opportunity for change, parties still rely on traditional bases. Although class dealignment was prominent in 2019 for Labour, they won them back in 2024, demonstrating that this is volatile.   |
| Partisan dealignment       | refers to weakening of voter loyalty to specific parties — leading to an increase in floating voters.              | Tories winning in 'Red Wall' constituencies in 2019, rise in Issue-Based voting (Labour on cost of living in 2024), rise in smaller parties, more tactical voting in marginal constituencies. | it seems like this has an incredible impact. Lower party membership across the board, broad dissatisfaction with Labour and the Conservatives... yeah. Although, with membership of the Greens soaring, who knows? |
