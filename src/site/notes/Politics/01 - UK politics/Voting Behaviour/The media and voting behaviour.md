# The media
## Introduction
### Dominant Ideology Theory
DIT suggests that ideas and beliefs within a society are shaped and maintained by those in power, often to uphold existing social structures and inequalities.

# Newspapers
They're no longer relevant and nobody cares about them. 

Newspapers in the UK can be broadly separated into two categories: tabloids and broadsheets.
- Tabloids are known for sensationalist headlines, gossip, and populism.
	- Examples include The Sun, The Daily Mirror, and The Daily Starr. 
	- In 2019, The Sun ran eye-catching headlines attacking Corbyn's leadership and Brexit stance
- Broadsheets are known for longer articles, in-depth analysis, and political coverage.
	- Examples include The Guardian, The Times, and The Telegraph.
	- During the 2024 general election, The Times analysed Labour's economic policy in great detail.

Many papers have an online presence.

### Political leaning of mainstream newspapers

|            | Left leaning          | Right leaning |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| Broadsheet | Private Eye, Guardian | The Telegraph |
| Tabloid    | Daily Mirror          | The sun       |
## The decline of print media
Print media's influence has declined due to the rise of digital platforms.
- The Sun's circulation fell from 3 million in 2010 to less than 1 million in 2024
- Younger voters use social media much more.

### Online presence of newspapers
Most papers now have websites where they publish most of their stuff. Many focus almost entirely on digital news, now.

## Assessment of the impact of print media
- 2019 election — despite the decline, print media reinforced political divisions. The Sun's anti-Corbyn campaign solidified tory support.
- 2024: not much impact on younger voters. However, the Daily Mail's endorsement of Tories may have swayed older voters.

# Television

> [!info] Statistics on TV
> 79% of the adult population use television as their main source for accessing the news.
> 93% of adults aged 65+ use television to access the news.
> 89% of 16–24-year-olds report that their main source of news is the internet.
> 85% of minority ethnic people access news from the internet rather than television.

## Broadcast TV
TV is subject to strict regulations to ensure impartiality, enforced by Ofcom.
- Broadcasters must provide balanced coverage of political parties
- Political advertising on TV and radio is prohibited. Instead, parties receive free airtime for Political Party Broadcasts (PPBs) which must also meet impartiality requirements. 

Print media faces no such obligations. The Sun could openly support the Conservatives in the last two elections, but the BBC and ITV are required to present balanced debates and coverage of all major parties.

### The rise of 24-hour news channels

- These channels provide continuous coverage of breaking news, political events, debates, and election results
	- During the 2019 GE, Sky ran extended analyses on Brexit's implications
- By 2024, 24-hour news channels face increased competition from online platforms, but they remain key for real-time election updates. 

In more recent years, TV debates and interviews have become more important. See Clegg's performance in a debate before the 2010 election, possibly leading to the coalition.

### Who watches TV?

- Older demographics (50+) are the primary consumers of live broadcast news
- Younger demographics favour clips of broadcast shared on social media. 
(Something something the fact that clips will be designed to get a reaction on social media means that only the most controversial clips will go viral.)
(also it's just going to go into your echo chamber.)

### The rise of opinion news
Yeah it's GB news. They do a LOT of social media work. Also, it isn't impartial in the slightest.

## Changing preferences

According to Ofcom, more adults are getting their news online (71%) rather than from TV (70%). Among The Kids, its even more pronounced — 88% of 16-24 use online sources, with only 49% using TV. 

Although the BBC still reaches 68% of adults in the UK. 

# Assessment of importance of traditional media

Broadcast continues to play a large role in shaping voting behaviour and public opinion. 

- Agenda setting: TV frames key election issues. In 2019, the BBC and Sky prioritized Brexit coverage.
- Trust: despite criticism, the BBC is still regarded as more trustworthy than social media or print outlets
- Polarisation: the rise of opinion news may have contributed to increased polarisation, although their viewership remains small in comparison to major broadcasters. 


| Yes, it has declined                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | No, it hasn't                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Younger voters increasingly gain political information from social media. In 2024, platforms like TikTok reached a third of young Britons.                                                                                                                                                                                            | During the 2019 UK general election, social media algorithms often promoted content that reinforced users’ existing beliefs, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Newspapers have dramatically declined in circulation in recent years. Between 2010 and 2019, major UK newspapers experienced significant drops in print circulation, prompting many to invest heavily in their online presence to retain readership.                                                                                  | Despite the rise of social media, traditional media remains a primary news source for many voters, especially older demographics who have higher voter turnout rates. In the 2019 UK general election, traditional outlets online were the most popular for general election news, indicating that traditional media still played a significant role in informing voters.                                                          |
| On-demand services and content apps like Netflix mean live viewing of TV (24-hour news or scheduled news programming) has decreased, leading people to not tune into TV news. By 2024, more British people got their news from the internet (71%) than from television (70%), marking a significant shift in news consumption habits. | Many newspapers have successfully transitioned to digital formats, maintaining or even expanding their readership through online platforms. By 2024, newspapers like The Guardian and The Times had substantial digital subscriber bases, allowing them to continue shaping political narratives and influencing voter opinions.                                                                                                   |
| Citizen journalism and the curation of news content mean people are pushed the news they want and agree with and won’t search it out from established sources such as the press and broadcast TV.                                                                                                                                     | Traditional media outlets provide editorial standards and fact-checking that help ensure the accuracy and reliability of information, which can counterbalance the echo chamber effect of personalised news feeds. In the 2024 UK general election, traditional media continued to serve as a counterbalance to the echo chambers of social media, offering fact-checked and comprehensive coverage that reached a broad audience. |

# New media — social media and online sources

The shift from print to digital media has sped up news delivery, creating a 24/7 news cycle that’s constantly updated online.

- Nowadays, people mainly get their news from websites and social media platforms like Twitter. This allows them to choose their own sources of information, which can reinforce their personal biases.
- Social media lets politicians communicate directly with the public, bypassing traditional media channels. This has changed the way political communication works.
- “Filter bubbles” on social media encourage users to engage with like-minded opinions and demonise opposing ones, reinforcing partisan views.
- A small, vocal minority on social media can significantly influence public discourse and mainstream media agendas, contributing to societal polarisation.
- While social media provides instant access to information, it also fosters division and hostility, affecting how people perceive each other and political figures.

### Misinformation
A report by the University of Oxford highlighted that organised social media manipulation campaigns were identified in 81 countries, including the UK. This was a 15% increase from the previous year. 

During the 2019 GE, the Tory press office rebranded it's twitter account as 'factcheckUK' during a leader's debate.

Additionally analysis revealed that 88% of the Conservative Party's Facebook advertisements during a specific period contained misleading information, compared to 0% of the Labour party.

Also, deepfakes.

# Is social media's influence overstated?

| Yes, it is overstated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | No, it is understated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Social media reinforces political beliefs by pushing content voters already agree with, so doesn’t change minds, justifies existing positions. During the 2019 UK general election, social media algorithms often promoted content that reinforced users’ existing beliefs on issues like Brexit, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives.              | Social media platforms have the potential to expose users to a wider range of viewpoints, which can influence and change voting behaviour. In the 2024 UK general election, political parties utilised social media to reach undecided voters, employing targeted advertising to present policy positions to those not firmly aligned with a particular party. |
| Despite the rise of online news consumption, traditional media outlets remain influential, especially among demographics with higher voter turnout. In the 2019 UK general election, traditional media outlets continued to play a significant role in informing voters, particularly older demographics who are more likely to vote.                     | Social media has become the number one source for news; 71% of all voters get their information from online sources.  <br>By 2024, more British people got their news from the internet (71%) than from television (70%), marking a significant shift in news consumption habits.                                                                              |
| This influence declines the higher up the age brackets you go, with older voters preferring broadcast media. Older voters have shown a preference for traditional broadcast media, relying on television and radio for their news consumption.                                                                                                            | The gap is narrowing as older demographics increasingly adopt online platforms for news consumption.  <br>By 2024, there was a noticeable increase in older voters engaging with news content online, indicating a shift in media consumption habits across age groups.                                                                                        |
| A lot of evidence suggests that trusted and well-sourced news is important to voters, and traditional media like the press are still able to set the agenda due to targeting age groups that have higher levels of turnout.                                                                                                                               | Information and news have been democratised on social media, allowing free access rather than requiring the purchase of a newspaper or subscription.  <br>Social media platforms provide users with free access to a vast array of news sources, reducing barriers to information.                                                                             |

| Social media has a symbiotic relationship with traditional media, with posts and content shared on platforms like TikTok and X coming from content newspapers and broadcast media created.  <br>Content from traditional media outlets is frequently shared and discussed on social media platforms, indicating a symbiotic relationship between the two. | Social media platforms also generate original content that influences traditional media coverage, highlighting a bidirectional relationship.  <br>During the 2024 UK general election, viral content originating on social media platforms often prompted coverage and discussion in traditional media outlets.                                                |
