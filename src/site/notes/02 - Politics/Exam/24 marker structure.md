Roughly 30 minutes to write one of these.

Overall structure is intro-three paragraphs-conclusion

In one paper, you get a choice of two which either can be on any of the three core ideologies. In the other paper, it's just anarchism.

## Paragraph structure

Point : **directly** compare two branches (do they broadly agree or disagree?) AND a THEME (not just one of the 4 areas of society (state/economy, etc) but be more specific.)

Explain: what does each branch believe, and why do they believe it. Fill it full of key terms. (You don't have the time to lay everything out. 'the proletariat don't own the means of production' versus something much longer.)

Thinker: mention a thinker, and link their ideas. Don't just say 'and Marx believed this. Moving on', you need to LINK.
> They are not looking for real world examples. Don't use them. 
> >also for Marxist thinkers from the soviet bloc : the exam board doesn't like them.
> theoretically, you can merge the explanation and thinkers, but only do that once you know wtf you are doing. (THIS IS AIMED AT ME, PERSONALLY.)

Analysis : challenge your point from earlier (whether they broadly agree or disagree) in order to find the *extent* of the agreement/disagreement

Link : basically just repeat your point at the start of the paragraph, reiterate our line of argument, and mention **how significant the theme is.**

### Miscellaneous points of interest

- don't just talk about two branches in an ideology, you will be marked down. 
- mention one thinker per paragraph.
- you can do a mix of similarities and differences as long as you are doing proper relevance evaluation.
- **always go for the easiest question. no matter what. doesn't matter.**

## What kind of questions can you be asked?

1. on the tenets (hard question >:(
these are the key ideas that hold an entire ideology together. For socialists, it's things like collective ownership, class, etc. 
2. how much do (ideologists) agree/disagree on the state/society/economy/human nature
3. completely random ones! 
can be very nice or very mean. can just be 'how much do socialists agree?' (wtf that's so easy) or smth like 'how much do neo-liberals and neo-conservatives agree with each other?' (don't do this if it comes up.)
