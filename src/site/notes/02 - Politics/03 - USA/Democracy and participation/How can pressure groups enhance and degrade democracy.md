| Representative | Allows smaller groups to have a say in policy even if they aren't directly in government. | Richer groups have crazy advantage with politicians.                                      |

| Pluralist      | Insider groups have less inherent power when power is shared.                             | it's harder to get large-scale change because one branch says yes but the other says no.  |

| Resource   | Why does it help them?                                                                         | US example                             | UK example                                        |

| Money      | Allows them to run campaigns, lobby, or donate to candidates.                                  | The fucking NRA- or Elongated Muskrat. | Keklmao the tories                                |

| Access     | Having relationships with legislators mean they have both influence and information on policy. | Heritage foundation                    | BCC, the British medical association              |
