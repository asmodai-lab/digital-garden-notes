## What is the context of the US constitution?

1. Americans see themselves as a rebellious people- this leads to an authoritarian approach to policing- whereas the police in the UK are taught to deescalate first. People generally don’t get killed during riots in the UK. and different conceptions of justice. In the UK, murder would get life and serve 15 years. You only serve the time of your longest sentence. In the US, sentences add up.
2. Americans care deeply about liberty. You see this in the UK with people like Jeremy Clarkson and rural farmers. In the UK, the government is paternalistic, in America it’s fuckin annoying.
3. Justice- high expectations of what the world is like. Expectations of ‘freedom’ depends on left and right- and they are very angry about it. Americans tend to lack cynicism in comparison to brits. US kids are brought up with the American dream. You can be president! You can be anything! Yippee! (That does not fuckin happen in UK.)

### Vague history

Pre-1500s- populated by native American tribes. They didn’t have gunpowder or smelted metal. This makes them vulnerable to European travellers.

1500-1700- many Europeans travel to the new world. The Spanish in particular plundered tribes for gold in the south.

In north America the tribes are less wealthy. Settling down was more common.

Virginia is the first colony established

Settlers were often religious outcasts and extremists fleeing religious wars in Europe. Many were protestant

1700-56- Spain, France and Britain speedrun colonising. European settlers move in after and while subjugating the native Americans

In areas with few settlers, treaties were drawn up between the natives and the settlers, but they were largely unfair

56-63- 7 years’ war. Huge global war. Britain won and became the dominant power in north America. However, it has been won by borrowing massive sums of money.

The brits decide to tax the Americas because the colonies benefited the most from those debts.

63-75- 13 colonies that run down the east coast. They are individual, not a single country. They are governed partly by Westminster and most of the inhabitants would have considered themselves British

1600s- the reformation and the renaissance lead to the enlightenment. John Locke- classical liberal, protestant.

He says we have three rights.

It is gods will that everybody is alive. If you murder someone, it goes against god’s will.

God created humans to be free. Anything that controls you (unfairly, unreasonably or unmorally) is going against gods will.

Everyone has a right to property. Something in the natural world+ your labour= your property

So, then the Americans are getting taxed out of their asshole. They think its shit because they can’t vote for it.

A group of people dressed up as native Americans storm the Boston harbour. They kick tea into the harbour. It’s called the Boston tea party.

Parliament gets mad and strips Massachusetts of its rights.

A small number gather and proclaim their independence from the British empire. its not that many people. They sign a document in 1776 called the declaration of independence.

Britain invades and seizes the coasts. The rebels are forced inland. They rebels are ground down and immortalised. At some point, Britain get bored and stops funding the army- who are eventually defeated. The rebels establish ‘these united states of America’

This country now needs federalism because they don’t have a national identity.


# What are the nature and principles of the constitution?

1. Codified constitution- constitution that is written into law
2. Judiciable constitution- can be enforced by the judiciary
3. Entrenched constitution- a provision that makes certain amendments either more difficult or impossible to pass
4. Implied powers- powers a body has that wasn’t explicitly given to them
5. Supermajority-a majority by greater than one half
6. Enumerated powers- powers specifically given by the constitution
4. A ‘necessary and proper clause’- authorizes congress to employ any means that are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end _(the permitted end being within the scope of federal power under the constitution)_

**Limited government, separation of powers, checks and balances, federalism.**

The US constitution comes into effect in 1789. It has seven articles, about 4,500 words, with an additional 3,000

1. Article 1- deals with congress. Shows they intended congress to be more important than the presidency
2. Article 2- presidency (presidency, not president
3. Article 3- federal courts
4. Article 4- Federalism
5. Amendments

### Messy notes
- The US Constitution is codified
	- this means that it is judiciable. Only federal courts can rule on this.
	- So, there is two layers of the law- normal and constitutional
	- It is designed to be hard to change
		- This is done by requiring supermajorities (66%) to change things. This was done in order to prevent tyranny of the majority
	- Some observers have suggested that this has created a ‘tyranny of the minority’ situation- where well-organised and well-motivated minority groups can undermine democracy. (this is typical of guns- about 2/3s want stricter gun control but this will never fucking happen)
		- **_Look up public choice theory_**
- a lot of the Constitution is very fucking vague because the founding fathers acknowledged that America is very big, diverse, and will outlive them
- **Enumerated powers-** powers with a number- a specific and explicit power given to an institution by the constitution
- **Implied powers-** powers that are not explicit, but flow logically (constitution says that the president has power over the army and navy- but it doesn’t mention the air force, because it didn’t exist at the time)
- **There is also the necessary and proper clause-** gives congress to do anything it wants to- within reason _(they gave money to the unemployed through the CARES act during COVID 19)_
- the constitution predates political parties, but barely. So, everyone was an independent
	- these independents would form factions when a major issue faces the country. (like pro-war and anti-war). Once the issue was resolved, the faction would disband
	- worried that a 51% faction forcing itself upon the 49% faction (supermajorities were introduced for this.)
- this whole situation is referred to a ‘bipartisanship’. However, this phrase has two meanings:
>a situation where two political parties exist
>a situation where two political parties must work together


## Amendments

1st — Freedom of speech, action, press and religion
2nd – keep and bear arms
3rd no soldiers in homes in peacetime (because food payments)
4th no unreasonable searches by police- police must have reasonable suspicion

6th fair and speedy trial, legal representation, and no hidden shit

10th powers not in the constitution go to the states
11th cant sue states in federal court
12th president and vice elected separately
13th abolishes slavery (terms and conditions may apply)
14th citizenship to all persons born in the USA (being a citizen means rights), and guidelines for districting
15th everyone can vote (men of colour edition)

### How is the constitution amended?
- Two-thirds (a supermajority) of both houses of Congress have to vote to introduce an amendment, or two-thirds of states can call a constitutional convention to propose amendments.
- Amendments require the formal support (ratification) of ¾ of states
1. Proposed by a 2/3 vote in congress, ratified by ¾ of the state legislatures
2. Proposed by a 2/3 vote in congress, ratified by conventions held in ¾ of the states
3. Proposed at a national convention called by congress when requested by 2/3 of the states, ratified by ¾ of the state legislatures
4. Proposed by national convention, ratified by conventions.

#### Pros and cons of this system


| Pros                                                                 | Cons                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Protects smaller states from tyranny of the majority                 | can make for tyranny of the minority      |
| hard to change — so a government can't just take away certain rights | hard to change when something is outdated |
| ensures fair checks and balances and state's rights                  | can make a weak government (?)            |

## Checks and balances

- When the constitution was being drafted, three of the founding fathers wrote short newspaper articles (the federalist papers)
- The goal was to convince votes what the constitution should look like, particularly around controversial issues
- They are useful for understanding how the founding fathers intended the constitution to be used
	- (we don’t actually know who wrote which)
- In paper 51, we think Madison/Hamilton is arguing for checks and balances
	- This is because each branch of government could have it’s own selfish motivations, which could be shit for the country
- So the other two branches have the power to stop this
	- So the phrase ‘checks and balances’ describes how each branch can limit and be limited in their powers
**This only works when there is a separation of branches**

## Other notes

14th amendment for redistricting asks that it is done in population — of which does not include native americans.
