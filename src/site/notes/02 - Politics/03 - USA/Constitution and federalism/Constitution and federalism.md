## Major questions

**How democratic is the Constitution today?

**Is the USA still federal?**


1. how effective is the constitution today?
2. how similar is it to the founding father's intentions?
3. how robust is it against challenges?

## Misc

### Was the constitution every meant to be democratic?

Short answer? No, probably not.

- the founding fathers did not like democracy, it was not their end goal.
	- the goal was limited government/preventing a tyrannical one.
	- Democracy, then, was their method of achieving this
- although they were aware of democracy's problems, so looked for a balance
	- i.e. no tyrannical government but also stopping a populist moron being elected by a moronic population.

#### How did they do this?

1. the electoral college — which means electors can override a decision. This doesn't happen much nowadays; there are actual laws against being an unfaithful delegate in many states (California, for example). It does, however, result in a 'wrong-way-around' vote.
	1. such as in:
		1. 2000
		2. 2016
		3. 2 other irrelevant times
2. An appointed senate. Senators were originally appointed by state governors: not directly elected. This was for the purposes of:
	1. continuing to reduce the impact of the uneducated
	2. allowing the more powerful house to not be impacted by the uneducated
3. Equal representation of states in the senate (2 each)
4. supermajorities
5. the supreme court

Also note that many groups lacked equal rights, AND that the federal constitution allows for undemocratic things to occur at a state level (gerrymandering, much, California?)
