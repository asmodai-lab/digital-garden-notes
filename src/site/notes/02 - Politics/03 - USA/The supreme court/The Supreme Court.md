## Judicial independence


How does the supreme court ensure that the judges are independent?

-          Justices are appointed for life, so they can’t be removed for the decisions they make

-          Vacancies only occur if a sitting justice retires, dies, or is impeached (VERY RARE) congress can theoretically change the number of justices- but the last time they did that was in the 1800s. this prevents other branches from packing the courts

-          The constitution explicitly forbids the salary of justices being lowered during their time in office. They get paid just under $300, 000 per year. It rises with inflation. With a fixed salary, justices don’t need to worry about retributive salary lowering for voting a certain way

-          Justices are nominated by the president and then confirmed by the senate. This means they both don’t have all-consuming power. They are still legitimized by being approved by a legislative body

-          The courts have their own power given by the separation of powers. The court can check the powers of congress and the president through judicial review. The court doesn’t have the actual power to enforce this ruling. However- this makes the three branches dependent on each other.

-          The American bar association (ABA) rates the suitability of nominated justices through a panel of non-politically motivated industry experts who aim to ensure the court is composed of people who understand and carry out the law rather than the will of a political party.
