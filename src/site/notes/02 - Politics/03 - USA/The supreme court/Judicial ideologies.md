## What is Judicial activism?
- this is when the supreme court rules an an issue rather than letting the president or congress solving it. This can be both liberal **(Obergefell v. Hodges- on gay marriage)** or conservative **(Citizens united v. FEC- allowing super PACS)**
- ==Judicial restraint== is when, rather than reaching decisions based on activism, judges tend to *stare decisis*- so, letting decisions stand. They are far more likely to use past court rulings to reach a decision. This can be liberal **(whole women's health v Hellerstead)** or conservative **(Dobbs v Jackson)**
- ==Judicial activism== is when judges actively interpret and apply the law — sometimes going beyond the explicit text of the Constitution, in order to address social issues and promote justice. It involves broader interpretation of the law and a more active role in shaping public policy.
