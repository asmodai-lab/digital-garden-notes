| Supremacy                                                              | In practice, supremacy lands in a lot of different places in both countries — such as in devolved bodies, and among different branches of government.                                                                                                                                                                                               | Constitutional Supremacy vs. Parliamentary sovereignty — Dobbs v. Jackson struck down federal abortion protections. The UK supreme court cannot overturn laws, but it can assess executive actions — like in Miller v. Cherry (Bojo prorogation ruling. |
| Removal of Presidency<br><br>(irrelevant to supreme court but helpful) | Removal options aren’t used often/ at all, but they are effective threats (Theresa May, Nixon)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Impeachment v. vote of no confidence — Trump v United States or Callaghan’s vote of no confidence.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Judicial review                                                        | They can both review actions of the executive (ordering the release of federal aid in 2025, and Miller v Cherry)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | US SC can review laws — such as in Moore v. Harper (2023) ruling on election laws. The UK SC can only review legality of government actions, not Acts of Parliament. This is demonstrated by the Rwanda decision.                                       |
| Independence                                                           | Judicial independence<br><br>-2022 appointment of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson<br><br>-2005 Constitutional Reform Act means that the UK Supreme Court is structured to function independently Parliament and the government, with justices appointed until the mandatory retirement age of 75, like the current President of the Court, Lord Reed. | Political nature — US SC justices are appointed politically (which means they are less independent), whereas the appointment process for the UK SC justices is done by selection committee.                                                             |
| Power of the courts                                                    | Final court of appeal<br><br>-2022 Dobbs v. Jackson<br><br>-2019 ruling on the prorogation of Parliament (Miller/Cherry case)                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The US supreme court has power; the UK supreme court has none. The actual final appeal is parliament acts. (Rwanda decision versus US SC ordering release of foreign aid.)                                                                              |
| Role of devolution in constitutional interpretation                    | Role in constitutional interpretation<br><br>-2023 Moore v. Harper<br><br>-2022 decision on the Scottish Parliament's attempt to legislate on independence                                                                                                                                                                                          | Parliament laws automatically affect all of the devolved bodies and cannot be opted out of — whereas abortion regulations, gun regulations, and minority protections are different from state to state.                                                 |
| Protection of rights                                                   | Protection of fundamental rights<br><br>-Bostock v. Clayton County (2020)<br><br>-Human Rights Act 1998<br><br>-2020 Elgizouli ruling on extradition & human rights                                                                                                                                                                                 | Constitutional v. legislative basis for rights — US rights are in the Bill of Rights and others (1st amendment: freedom of speech), whereas rights are in the Human Rights Act 1998 which is not codified.                                              |
| Appointment process                                                    | Appointment processes designed to ensure judicial<br><br>-Lifetime or long-term tenure (Lifetime for US, retirement of 75 for UK)<br><br>-                                                                                                                                                                                                          | US justices are lifetime and appointed by the President. UK justices are appointed by a selection commission and have a mandatory retirement age.                                                                                                       |
