**The spec asks us to know:**
 - How different pressure groups exert influence and how their methods and influence vary in contemporary politics.
- Case studies of two different pressure groups, highlighting examples of how their methods and influence vary.
- Other collective organisations and groups including think tanks, lobbyists and corporations, and their influence on Government and Parliament


A key part of UK democracy is pressure groups. The definition of pressure groups is quite wide- basically any organized group which is **not** the government working to influence government policy counts- which does lowkey make the opposition political parties count. But don't include that in an essay, it's a bit cheeky. 

## Types of pressure groups
[[07 - Excalidraw/Pressure group methods UK\|Pressure group methods UK]]

|          | Promotional                         | Sectional                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Insider  | Confederation of British Industry   | Trade unions (with Labour) |
| Outsider | Just Stop Oil, Extinction rebellion | National education Union   |

### Case study: Extinction Rebellion
>[!EXAMPLE] Extinction Rebellion
> They declare themselves to be a ‘a politically non-partisan international movement that uses non-violent direct action to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency'
> >They are an outsider group by choice and a sectional group.
> >
> >It uses direct action because it believes that ‘conventional approaches of voting, lobbying, petitions and protest have failed because powerful political and economic interests prevent change'
> 
> >[!Info] It's objectives
> >1. The government must tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency
 >>2. The government must act now to reduce greenhouse emissions to net zero by 2025 (old textbook haha)
 >>3. the government must create and be led by recommendations from a citizen's assembly on climate justice.
 >
 >>[!WARNING] It's impact
 >> Their first demand had some success. By 2020, 460> plus the Scottish & Welsh Parliaments had declared a climate emergency. The Commons adopted a climate emergency motion in 2019, although it was non-binding
 >> 
 >> Their second demand was much less successful, because the Tory govt. didn't like it, as well as business interest groups.
 >>> In 2019, Parliament did pass legislation that required the UK to reduce it's net emissions by 100% relative to 1990 levels by 2050 (previous target was 80%.) But the govt. already wasn't on track to reach the 80% in 2008, so despite the ban on sale of new petrol and diesel cars extending to 2030, the govt has not been successful on this front.
 > 
 >> The third demand has been the least achieved. Only a few MPs like it, and it isn't supported widely in the main political parties. 
 > 
 > On the whole, Extinction Rebellion has achieved widespread media coverage as well as putting debate over the threat of climate change into public consciousness. 
 > > it led to the **radical flank effect** — i.e. even if many didn't like Extinction Rebellion, it still increased support for less extreme climate action groups, like Greenpeace.

## Think tanks

**Many see think tanks as good for democracy by carrying out policy research, developing policy options, and aiding public debate.**

**Critics argue that think tanks push policies and evidence that favours the interests of the corporations that fund them, undermining democracy.**
> Think tanks have very little transparency, since they don't need to declare the sources of their funding, and politicians don't need to declare meetings with think tanks in the same way they do with corporations. 
> > The IEA lists the five main areas it's funding comes from, but does not reveal names of company or individual donators due to privacy concerns.
> 
> Critics argue that it is not possible for politicians or the public to trust the independence or objectivity of a think tank if they do not know who funded it.
> > Think tanks maintain that this is people who are opposed to their ideas using the funding question to attack them, rather than engaging in debate.

## Corporations

Corporations do not vote, but they still have a huge impact in elections: because huge corporations are so vital to the economy, of course they have a say in laws and regulations on taxes/the environment/foreign trade deals/workers rights/ etc.

**The argument for:**
> Since corporations are crucial to the economy, it's important that their voice is heard.
> > the success of our economy depends on firms investing and employing in Britain. Since corporations have such a big stake in society, it only makes sense that they should get their opinions heard in policy that affects them.
> They tend to be organised into effective blocks
> >like the *British Bankers Association* (BBA) — whose tag line is 'the voice of banking.'
> They have generally built up strong government ties, they've got high levels of expertise in their areas that can be used by the government to improve policy, and many are wealthy enough to employ lobbyists or lobbying firms.

**The argument against**:
> The role of corporations in politics invites the question of if group politics is a level playing field.
> > Corporations possess wealth, economic influence, organisation and expertise to ensure that they have a head start in influencing govt. policy.
> The natural counterbalance to corporations (in terms of worker's rights) is trade unions, but their membership and power has been declining since the 1970s (i.e. Margaret Thatcher), with only around 1 in 10 workers in the private sector being unionised in 2020.
> > Although, note that corporations **don't have the power to vote in elections**, which is — obviously — crucial for politicians. 


## Lobbying

Lobbying Act (2014)-
- created a register of lobbyists. Anyone who meets the statutory definition of lobbying must sign register and account for their lobbying activities
	- their definition is "contacting a UK government minister or permanent secretary (or equivalents) on behalf of a third party, in return for payment."
This means that the register is only applicable to individuals or firms lobbying on behalf of a third party- meaning companies with in-house lobbyists (generally the most powerful) are largely unaffected. 
- an estimated only 4% of lobbyists were actually on the register. 
	- In addition to this, there are rules of what lobbying roles former Ministers and Civil Servants can take. There are time limits in place to prevent Ministers and Senior Civil Servants from becoming lobbyists straight away. This is to try to limit the ‘revolving door’ problem.

#### Statistics
- the annual spend on lobbying in the UK is estimated to be £2 billion
- it is estimated that 4,000 people work in the lobbying industry
- 8/10 are from FTSE 100 companies

### David Cameron and the Greensill scandal 

Former PM David Cameron- upon leaving the position became a paid advisor to Greensill Capital, a company owned by a guy who had previously been an advisor to him. He received a salary and significant shares in the company.

In 2020, Cameron attempted to persuade government ministers to allow Greensill onto the list of companies getting Government insured loans. He contacted them over 45 times in the span of 3 months. 

Cameron did not break the Lobbying Act (that he had introduced) because he did not technically count as a lobbyist because he was employed directly by Greensill. He also had extraordinary influence as a former PM- and he used it for financial gain.
