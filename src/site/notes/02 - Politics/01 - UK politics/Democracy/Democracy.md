### Major debates:
1. Evaluate the view that the UK is suffering from a participation crisis
2. evaluate the view that direct democracy is superior to representative democracy
3. evaluate the view that democracy in the UK is in need of reform
4. evaluate the view that reforms to UK democracy can tackle the democratic deficit in the UK
### what is democracy?
In the Athenian model, democracy meant putting power back in the hands of ordinary people: giving them time and information to come up with effective solutions to the problems of the day and doing it frequently to increase understanding and participation.

What is democracy? There are 5 major features:

1. **Participation**: before a decision is made, all have equal and effective opportunity to make their opinions known to others about how that decision should be made
2. **Voting equality**: every member must have equal and effective opportunity to vote, and all votes must be counted as equal
3. **Understanding**: each person must have equal and effective opportunities for learning about relevant choices and outcomes
4. **Agenda setting**: each person must have an opportunity to decide how to set the agenda and what to place on it so that past decisions are open to be revisited
5. **Universal**: all adults should have the same rights that, as citizens, are necessary for participation, voting equality, understanding and setting the agenda.







## Messy notes
There are different types of democracy. The general definition is 'ruled by the people'- so not actually very specific. 

The UK is a constitutional monarchy- as is France and Spain. It is kind of irrelevant, since the king has almost no power. 

Because democracy can be quite literally almost anything- it is wise to define the terms in your essays. 

Typically, questions will involve how we can 'better' democracy. This will usually include:
- increasing participation (therefore increasing legitimacy) (this can include discussion of non-voting participation in [[02 - Politics/01 - UK politics/Democracy/Pressure groups, Lobbyists and think tanks\|Pressure groups, Lobbyists and think tanks]])
- increasing legitimacy of the mandate
- increasing the size of [[02 - Politics/01 - UK politics/Democracy/The Franchise\|The Franchise]]
- subjective qualities- such as:
-> strength of government
-> increased [[02 - Politics/01 - UK politics/Democracy/Rights in context\|protection of rights]] (which can be incredibly subjective)
-> increasing the dignity of politics (i.e. not letting immoral acts go unpunished)
-> whether we are having a participation crisis


**Methods of democracy:** 

- Direct democracy: the electorate decides on policy without representatives
- Pluralist democracy: multiple groups, not the people as a whole, can govern, direct and manage society.
- Representative democracy:
- citizens vote for representatives to decide policy
- Liberal democracy- rights and freedoms are officially recognized and protected; excessive political power is limited by the rule of law
- Proletariat democracy- peasants/ industrial workers are in charge of society
