## The debate (short version)

## Major points (long version)
### in favour of direct democracy
#### Genuine 'democracy'
**Direct democracy is the only pure form of democracy:** it ensures that people only have to obey laws that they make themselves. Popular participation in government is the essence of freedom and determining collective destiny.

Representative democracy means that **there will always be a gulf between the government and the people.**
> this can lead to political apathy as citizens feel powerless. Governments therefore govern in the name of the people: requiring their will (i.e. the mandate), but in practice, people have little meaningful control over the government. This is a common attitude in the UK.

> *2019 report*

#### Personal development
**Direct democracy creates better informed and more knowledgeable citizens**, because it encourages people to take more interest in politics.
> In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish referendum, 16+ schoolchildren were educated on the possible implications of remaining or separating from England

Whereas with representative democracy, votes take place so infrequently that **people 'switch off' from politics.**
> As a result, effective understanding of politics decreases (see below), reducing the ability of people to vote effectively even when they can vote: reducing effective participation and voting equality: especially because we simply do not have the resources to educate people (see Kier Starmer's policy on 16+ voting in England getting pushback from teachers because they don't have the resources to educate kids)

#### Ending professional politics
**Direct democracy would reduce/remove the public's dependence on self-serving career politician**s. This would increase public trust, political understanding, participation, and decrease corruption, along with increasing legitimacy.

**Representative democracy places too much faith in politicians,** who are liable to distort public opinion and not act for the sake of people— more interested in furthering personal objectives over those of the people — more focused on winning elections than arriving at long-term solutions.
- in 2019, a Hansard Society study found that 63% of people felt that the political system was rigged to the advantage of the rich and powerful.
> it amounts to 'government by politicians'; acting only in name but not for sake of the people. The political class is not widely representative of the global public.
> > Every PM since 1937 (except Gordon Brown) went to Oxford.
- 23% of MPs were educated privately (current), compared to 7% of the population.
	- 63% of MPs were comprehensively educated, compared to 88% of the general population
- in 2019, this was 54% comprehensive educated MPs, with 29% from private schools, and the same percentages for the general population.
- if the HoC represented the UK ethnic minority population, there would be ~104 MPs from minority ethnic backgrounds. There is currently 90, 66 in the last election
- ~40% of MPs are women, compared to half of the population.

#### Legitimate government
**Direct democracy insures that the government's rule is legitimate:** people are more likely to accept decisions that they had a say in. When citizens make decisions directly, they have to take responsibility: there is nobody else to blame. This ensures legitimacy for decisions.

**Representative democracy in the UK is experiencing a crisis**. Voter turnout remains low and people feel disengaged from politics, it's institutions and processes. Overall satisfaction with the system of governing in the UK has been on a downward trend: from the first Hansard *Audit* in 2004 of 36% satisfaction, to 25% in 2019.

### in favour of representative democracy
#### Practicality
**Direct democracy is only achievable in relatively small communities;** especially if the government is formed my mass-meeting.
> this would be unworkable in modern conditions. High levels of face-to-face interaction is basically impossible in societies with millions of people.

**Representative democracy can actually function in a large society.** It's a practical solution; and it doesn't mean that aspects of direct democracy can't be incorporated.

##### Division of labour in politics
One of direct democracy's major drawbacks is that **politics is a job for all citizens, restricting their ability to do other things.**
> in ancient Athens, their solution was that foreigners and slaves did the bulk of the work and women looked after children. The 'citizens' of Athens was a tiny group — which excluded women, immigrants and slaves: who made up 3/5 of the population.

**Representative democracy relieves citizens of this burden:** especially when countries cover large amounts of land.

> [!warning] An issue with this point
> It's perfectly possible to have the same system of government that we do now, but with delegates; not representatives. That would solve the practicality issues.

#### Government by experts
**Direct democracy isn't a sensible way to make complex decisions**. Many of the big issues facing the UK don't have easy or clear solutions — which can't be found without expertise.

**Representative democracy puts these decisions in the hands of people whose job it is to know about this** and make a better decision on behalf of the people.
> For example, 75% of MPs supported Remain in Brexit, because they could more easily recognise the facts of the situation in comparison to the general public who got blasted with propaganda and misleading information.

#### Political stability
**Direct democracy can engage people too much, creating deep divisions in society**. In cases where direct democracy creates clear winners and losers over a political choice, it will be very hard for the losers to see the political choice as legitimate.

**Representative democracy, however, maintains stability by distancing citizens from politics and encouraging them to accept compromise**. A certain level of apathy is helpful in maintaining political stability. The more involved in decision making citizens are, the more passionate and committed they may become.

> [!warning] An issue with this point
> This doesn't make a society more democratic, just docile. While non-violence is good, docility is just as bad; essentially allowing the government free reign.
