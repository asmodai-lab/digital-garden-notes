## How does the Swiss system work?
### Context — what is Switzerland like?

- Switzerland is a country with a population of ~9 million people.
- it is VERY rich. Things also cost a ridiculous amount of money.
- almost every house has a nuclear bunker underneath
- there isn't a 'Swiss' language — multiple dialects are spoken, but none are written
	- in the part that I'm most familiar with, they speak swiss-german. This is language is mostly unrecognisable to German people. However, this is entirely spoken — there is no 'written' swiss-german. There are some spelling quirks, but everything is written in normal German — since every schoolchild (in the region, at least) speaks normal German.
	- official communications are in German, as well as many TV programs.
	- the other dialects spoken include a variation of French, and Italian
- it has 26 'cantons' — similar to US states. They generally regulate everything slightly differently
	- there are 26 slightly different school systems, for example
		- the school system is similar to the US, with 3 major stages. Although students generally start and end much earlier in the day than in England. Also, no uniform.
- University isn't the majority post-school option — most people get degree-apprenticeships. You can get them in almost anything — mechanics, teaching at any stage, etc.
- there is mandatory 2 year military service for men post-18.
- the public transport is extensive and amazing
- Switzerland is not part of the EU, but they do have a lot of deals with the EU.
- healthcare is private

and some funnier facts
- my mother once dated a man named 'Wolfgang' (yes, that is a real name)
- you can go and visit the places where they make cheese
- the capital city is Bern, NOT ZURICH OR GENEVA
- in swiss-german, they don't say 'nein' to mean 'no', they say 'neigh' (yes, like a horse)
	- also, they say 'merci' instead of 'danke'
- it has a massively aging population (there are so many old people, and they all have the exact same haircut)
- in Solothurn (the canton that my mum is from) they have a big festival/parade type thing every year — people get dressed up, there's floats, music, specialty food, etc etc.
- they ALSO hate the French 
- everyone handshakes everyone when you meet (like, for food) and then also when you leave. Every single time.

## The structure of the Swiss political system
Switzerland is (probably) the only direct democracy in the world. What does this mean?
- TLDR: almost every major policy gets put forth to the entire Swiss population, in a vote once every quarter. (and by 'major' I mean 'almost everything'. Tax changes are on there.)

There isn't a two party system. There are ~7 popular parties. They use proportional representation, and were the (probably) the first country in the world to use it in elections.

At the top, there is the 'federal council' (the 'bundesrat') — 7 people who act as the 'presidency'. The one that is the 'president' (which is more of a head of state-type role, they don't have any specific powers, it's more a 'face of the country/meeting foreign diplomats' deal), changes each year. 
- the makeup of parties is proportional to the elections — so there are generally 2 of each main party plus a floater. Which specific people these are, are elected by the party membership.

The highest parliament is the federal assembly. It's elected by proportional representation, and mostly proposes policy.

Then Switzerland is split up into the aforementioned 26 cantons. Each works similarly to a US state, having their own powers, parliament, and regulations.

It's further split into council-type parliaments for towns/cities/etc.
- (apparently) most people start out in politics through the lowest power (i.e. the councils), of which they then move up.

**So, then how is it a direct democracy?**
- 4 times a year, there is a letter/ballot sent out, with various things in them
	- this includes both proposed government policies, and petitions (called 'volksinisitive') which get more than 120,000 signatures.
	- there also is a booklet which explains the proposals and the opposition to the proposals, along with a recommendation on what is the best option. It's very in-depth, but apparently uses quite legalistic language
		- there is also an app that explains policies, made for younger people. Apparently it's quite popular/good (? - as according to my interviewee)
	- there are policies for the whole country, and some specific to one's canton. It generally contains ~4 ish proposals.
- most major government proposals will be voted on using this method.

**Do they have a constitution?**
- eh. It is both a 'yes and no' answer, same as the UK, but it's not similar to the UK constitution aside from that. From what I've grasped, because everyone can vote on everything, the 'constitution' is just the same as the law — there are some principles abided by the governments, but they seem to be more convention than official law.

> [!note] note from further research
> The above was the answer from my aunt. From further research, they do have a constitution — but it's barely similar to the US constitution.
> First, it can be amended by simple majority in all the cantons and by all voters. According to the official website, it is amended regularly. This last happened just before 2000
> Second, it isn't sovereign. The federal courts cannot strike down a law on the basis of unconstitutionality, except in cases of conflict between federal law and international law.
> It's only power is in that it is sovereign above all lower legislation (i.e. in cantons)

### Swiss political culture
**How can they do this?**
- this sounds quite expensive and tedious, right? That's because it is. The major reason why it works is because Switzerland is a) a very small country, and b) a very rich country — they can AFFORD to do this. 

**What is interest in politics like?**
- average turnout in these (non-googled, as according to interviewee) is ~40%, and it's lower when you go lower down the rung.
	- most don't vote on every proposal, just the ones that matter to them.
	- keep in mind that — for a volksinisitive to get through, it must get 120,000 signatures. It can be voted on for — theoretically — an infinite number of times, BUT getting that number of signatures is a LOT of work. Several do get through every time, though.
		- there have been several things voted on multiple times — like military service, which has been voted on about a dozen times in the last half-century.
	- some policies do get significantly higher turnout. Until recently, age of retirement was different for men and women (64 for women and 65 for men). This has been voted on multiple times, but didn't get equalised until recently (although, note that 'recently' could be any time in the last half-decade). That vote got ~60% turnout.

**What is Swiss opinion on their own politics?**
- (note that this is from ONE PERSON and so does not represent the whole country in the slightest)
- they seem to quite like it. If there is a policy, they either voted on it, or had the chance to vote on it — meaning there (seems to be) less political unrest.
