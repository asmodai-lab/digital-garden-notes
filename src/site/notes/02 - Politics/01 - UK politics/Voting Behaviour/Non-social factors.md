# Other non-social factors
## Campaigning
A strong campaign can be important to mobilise voters. In the 2019 election, the Tory 'get Brexit done' message was very popular with voters. 

However, the existence of safe seats, state of the economy, or long-term voter trends are often more important than a campaign. 

Labour's sweep in 2024 was largely due to public dissatisfaction with the Conservative government, not due to their campaign. 

## Rational choice model
The rational choice model posits that voters vote based on their self-interests and policies advocated by political parties. 

### Valance Issues
Issues where there is a broad consensus among voters what is good — such as a strong economy, the NHS, or national security. 
	The election then becomes about which party can deliver better outcomes.

### Salient issues
Issues that are important to voters at the time, which tend to change election on election. For example — Brexit in 2019, or now immigration.

### Track record
Track record in government or actions of a candidate. This is more of a concern for the incumbent candidate. We can see this in how the Conservatives lost horribly in the 2024 election.

#### Leader and party image
A charming leader is more appealing. Take Blair and Johnson. Or nowadays, Reform is entirely coasting by on the popularity of Farage. 

### Manifesto
The media only covers the main points or the controversial policies. Most of the time they don't matter, but take Theresa May's 'dementia tax.'

## Voting Context model
The voting context model is similar to the rational choice model, but is more to do with the external factors of a particular election than individual's choices.

### Tactical voting
Individuals strategically vote for a candidate or party to prevent the election of a less preferred candidate/party.
#### Protest voting
Individuals that cast their vote as a form of protest or to express dissatisfaction with the political system or other things. 

### By-elections
Elections held to fill a vacant seat in a legislative body, occurring between general elections. Almost entirely used to show dissatisfaction with the current government. (Take reform's fucking sweep in council elections.) 

### Opinion polls
Refer below.

#### Bandwagon effect
Phenomenon where the popularity of a candidate convinces others to vote for them — often based off of opinion polls.
#### Boomerang effect
Phenomenon where negative attacks on a candidate result in increased support for them. (Trump.)



## Opinion Polls

### Why are Opinion polls conducted?

1. Understanding public opinion
2. Shaping political campaigns
3. Informing media coverage
4. Supporting academic research
5. Engaging the electorate

#### Types of opinion polls

1. Voting intention
2. Leadership approval
3. Exit polls
4. Tracking polls (a. k. a. issue/opinion)
5. MRP (multilevel regression and post-stratification) (predicts how a constituency votes.)
		*MRPs predicted Johnson breaking through the Red Wall.*

### Do opinion polls affect voting behaviour?

| Yes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | No                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Polls can create a bandwagon effect. For instance, in the 2019 GE, polls predicting a significant Tory lead may have convinced undecided voters to back them, or convinced opposed voters to not vote, convinced a Tory victory was inevitable.                        | Many voters make decisions based on things other than polls. The 'Red Wall' shift in 2019 was caused by long-term dissatisfaction with Labour's stance on Brexit and economic policies.                                                  |
| Media coverage amplifies poll's importance — take Reform's current showing in the polls and showing in Media.                                                                                                                                                          | Polls are only paid attention to by those who follow politics and elections closely. For instance, polls in 2024 showing shifts in younger voter turnout became focal on social media — and young voter turnout dropped from ~47%->~37%. |
| Polls can mobilise voters who fear that their preferred party is trailing. For example, in the 2019 GE, polling data suggested a possible hung parliament, potentially motivating Tory voters to turn out.                                                             | The majority of voters have a preference before campaigns begin, so polls have little impact. In 2019, Scotland continued to back the SNP despite polling trends.                                                                        |
| Strategic voting can be influenced by polls, especially in marginal constituencies. For example, in the 2024 GE, polling data highlighted tight races in the South East, leading calls for Lib-Dem voters to vote for Labour in key constituencies to unseat Tory MPs. | Inaccurate or poorly conducted polls can be misleading. In 2024, a widely shared (but flawed) poll underestimated Labour's performance in the Midlands, creating false expectations of a conservative hold in marginal seats.            |
