## 1979 — Thatcher
![Pasted image 20260107093658.png](/img/user/05%20-%20Images/1.1/Pasted%20image%2020260107093658.png)
### Overview
Large dissatisfaction with Callaghan's government due to economic unrest, unemployment, and disruptive strikes, laid fertile ground for the Conservatives to come in promising deregulation, lowered trade union power, and economic stability.

### Factors
#### Party policy and campaigns

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Thatcher </span>campaigned on the slogan: **'Time for a change'**. Her policies were:
- prioritising free-market principles
- individual ownership (**specifically of property**)
- deregulation
- tax cuts
- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> 'Right to Buy':</span> which allowed council tenants to purchase their homes
- limiting the powers of trade unions

Also, the Conservatives commissioned a poster from an advertising party, with the slogan<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> 'Labour isn't working.' </span>
> It represented the high unemployment and Labour's perceived economic failings. Although Thatcher had lover approval ratings than Callaghan, her media-focussed campaign countered doubts about her leadership.
> > This poster became incredibly memorable. It targeted aspirational middle-class voters who were frustrated by industrial action and high taxes.
> > 
> > Thatcher's image as the 'iron lady' was carefully crafted, strongly contrasting Labour: which appeared weak and divided.
![Pasted image 20260107091446.png](/img/user/05%20-%20Images/1.1/Pasted%20image%2020260107091446.png)


<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Callaghan's Labour</span> had very different policies:
- maintaining support for public services and welfare
- curbing inflation through agreements with trade unions to restrict wage demands
- tax cuts (to appeal to centrist voters)

#### Context
The election followed the defeat of the Labour government in a no-confidence motion, six months before Parliament was due for dissolution.

The 'Winter of Discontent' was a period in 78-79 marked by widespread strikes and economic instability, inflation, unemployment, etc.

Labour's inability to manage this damaged their credibility. Callaghan's "Crisis? What Crisis?" only reinforced this.
> Additionally, his decision to delay the election from 1978 was widely criticised as a strategic miscalculation, as it gave the Conservatives an opportunity to capitalise on growing public dissatisfaction.
> 
> Additionally, all the challenges gave the Tories fertile ground to present themselves as the party of change and stability.

#### Social factors
Traditional class-based voting patterns persisted, although this election did signal notable shifts.
- middle class voters: <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">59%</span> support for conservatives and<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> 24% </span>for Labour
- Labour retained it's majority support among working-class voters, although the Tories did make significant gains amongst skilled working-class voters: where support between the two parties was evenly split

Other demographic factors also played a role.
> The "gender gap": where women tended to be more conservative than men, was evident in this election, where the conservatives secured much of the female vote.

This election also saw the emergence of a North-South divide in politics.

The media: specifically the right-wing press, strongly supported Thatcher and the conservatives. Labour, however, struggled with limited media backing and negative coverage.

### Outcome

The election had a turnout of 76%.

Conservatives<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> 43.9%</span> of the vote and a<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> +43 majority. </span>

Labour got <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">36.9%</span> of the vote and lost<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> 50</span> seats. The Liberal party got <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">13.8%</span> of the vote.

The election saw a<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> 5.2%</span> swing from<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> Labour</span> -><span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> Conservative</span>, reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with Labour.

>[!example] Effect on politics
> Thatcher's victory marked the end of the post-war consensus, shifting away from Keynesian economics and welfare-focussed policies towards privatization, deregulation, the free market, and reduced union power.
> 
> This election also highlighted a decline in class-based voting, with the Conservatives gaining ground amongst skilled working-class voters: a tend that continued.

## 1997 — Blair
![Pasted image 20260107093757.png](/img/user/05%20-%20Images/1.1/Pasted%20image%2020260107093757.png)
### Overview
With the rebranded 'New Labour', Blair won a landslide victory against John Major's government. This was because of carefully crafted strategy to modernise Labour and shift to the centre: shedding their socialist roots, and partly because of fatigue with the Conservatives and scandals that marred Major's government.

### Factors
#### Policies and campaigning
Blair's 'New Labour' ran under a carefully designed platform under the slogan "**New Labour, New Britain**". Their policies included:
- the 'five-point pledge card', which outlined practical and tangible policies, such as:
	- cutting class sizes
	- reducing NHS waiting lists
	- fast-tracking punishment for persistent young-offenders
	- introducing welfare-to-work programmes (aka 'workfare')
	- ensuring no income tax increases for basic-rate payers

Blair also moved the party sharply right. He<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> rejected Clause IV</span>: which committed Labour to <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">nationalisation</span>, and switched to focussing on fiscal responsibility.
> They positioned themselves in the same way Thatcher did: with a media-first campaign, emphasising stability and credibility: away from their <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">'loony left'</span> image.
> 
> It was focused on <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">centrist voters</span>: adopting moderate policies and avoiding radicalism. This<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> attracted floaters, disillusioned Conservatives, and professionals from middle-England</span>. Blair's charisma resonated across party lines.
> > Critically, they had a strong media endorsement.<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> The Sun's endorsement</span> (a paper who endorsed Thatcher) symbolised wide media alignment with Labour: which targeted suburban and aspirational working-class voters.

John Major's campaign struggled to articulate a compelling vision for the future. Their slogan, **"New Labour, New Danger,"** failed to resonate with voters wanting change. They relied entirely on negative campaigning to undermine Blair, which failed to gain traction. Additionally, they were deeply affected by negative perception of the Conservatives due to infighting, scandals, and lack of confidence in their economic policy.
> funnily enough, produced by the same company that produced Thatcher's 'Labour isn't working' poster.
![Pasted image 20260107100305.png](/img/user/05%20-%20Images/1.1/Pasted%20image%2020260107100305.png)

#### Context
Major's government suffered multiple scandals: internal divisions over the EU, the "Cash for Questions" scandal, and economic fallout from Black Wednesday (1992)— when the UK was forced to exit the Exchange Rate Mechanism: which dealt a severe blow to the Tories' reputation for economic competence. General sleaze and allegations of corruption further tarnished the Tory brand.

#### Social and Electoral factors
Labour's victory reflected major shifts in traditional voting patterns: especially class-based patterns.
- Labour made significant gains among middle-class voters who previously supported the Tories.
	- they retained their stronghold among working-class voters
- they also managed to regain support from the aspirational working-class who had shifted to Thatcher in '79

With other social factors:
- Labour made gains among female voters because of their policies on education, healthcare, and stability.
- younger voters overwhelmingly supported Blair
- older voters, disillusioned by Conservative economic failures, shifted towards Labour.

They also made gains in the conservative-dominated South-East. 
- the Conservatives failed to gain a single seat in Scotland
- Michael Portillo lost his Enfield Southgate seat, epitomising the scale of collapse in Tory support.

### Results and impact
Turnout was 71.4%

Labour got 43.2% of the vote and a +179 majority.

The Conservatives won 30.7% of the vote, losing 178 seats, marking their worst defeat since 1832.

The Lib-dems won 16.8% of the vote and got 46 seats, a gain of 28.

There was a 10.2% swing from Tory -> Labour, highlighting public desire for change.

Labour's landslide victory marked the end of 18 years of Tory dominance and established a new consensus centred on Blair's modernisation agenda. 
> It also marked the growing influence of the media and shrinking influence of social factors in coting behaviour. The Sun's endorsement symbolised broader realignment with media support towards Labour.
> 
> Blair's focus on the centre reshaped Labour and it's image, aligning it with the middle-class and more economically conservative voters.

## 2019 — Johnson
![Pasted image 20260107102030.png](/img/user/05%20-%20Images/1.1/Pasted%20image%2020260107102030.png)
### Overview
The 2019 election was characterised overwhelmingly by Brexit. The Conservative "Get Brexit Done" campaign appealed to public fatigue over how long Brexit was taking. It was clear and uncomplicated. On the other hand, Labour was perceived as ambiguous on Brexit, which lost them confidence amongst voters on their ability to deliver on national issues. 

There were various other domestic issues too: such as the NHS, education, and policing. The Conservative manifesto focussed on these areas with promises of more funding, contrasting Labour's costly proposals: which, while ambitious, led voters to think there may be increased taxes.

### Factors
#### Policies and campaign
The Conservative message was clear and concise: "Get Brexit Done," appealing to public fatigue. They also had other key policies:
- increased funding for the NHS, education, and policing
- introducing a points-based immigration system
- significant infrastructure investment, 'levelling up' disadvantaged regions.

Their clear message, on top of Johnson's image and media-friendly campaign proved highly effective. They used targeted social media advertisements to connect with specific demographics: including Leave voters in marginal constituencies — allowing them to capitalise on fatigue over Brexit and contrasting their decisive approach with Labour's indecision.

Labour's campaign faced significant challenges, particularly over it's unclear stance on Brexit. The party proposed renegotiating a Brexit deal and holding a second referendum, which was seen as overly complex and alienated Leave voters in Labour's traditional heartlands. Their policies included:
- re-nationalising key industries
- significant investment in the NHS and education
- a 'green industrial revolution' to address climate change
This greatly appealed to some voters, but their complexity and cost concerns made them struggle to gain traction over the Brexit narrative, along with scepticism with Corbyn's leadership.

#### Context
The election was held in the shadow of the Brexit stalemate: years of parliamentary gridlock and indecision and voter fatigue — many just wanted it to be over. Frustration with the political establishment played to the Conservatives' advantage, as their clear stance contrasted sharply with Labour's perceived ambiguity.

Other issues such as public services, climate change, and economic inequality influenced voter choices. But these were secondary to the overwhelming focus on Brexit.

![Pasted image 20260107102955.png](/img/user/05%20-%20Images/1.1/Pasted%20image%2020260107102955.png)

#### Social factors
All new: **major class dealignment!**
- Tories made significant gains among Leave voters, including in the 'Red Wall'
	- working-class voters support for Labour eroded, especially in the aforementioned red wall.
Other social factors:
- gendered patters were less pronounced in 2019
- younger voters backed Labour because of their policies on climate change and social justice, but older voters overwhelmingly backed the Tories
- Labour remained the majority in ethnic minorities, but turnout was lower among ethnic minorities compared to previous elections
- The SNP dominated in Scotland, capitalising on opposition to Brexit

### Outcome
Turnout was 67.3%

Conservatives got 43.6% of the vote, with a +80 majority and a gain of 48

Labour got 32.1% of the vote and 202 seats overall, losing 60 seats

The SNP got 3.9% of the vote and 48 seats, with a gain of 13

The Lib-Dems got 11.5% of the vote and 11 seats with a loss of 1.

This was their best performance since 1987, and Labour's worst defeat since 1935. The election saw clear class dealignment, with Conservatives breaking through the Red Wall: the collapse which showed working-class voters abandoning Labour, and sharp regional divides with the SNP's dominance in Scotland.

It also highlighted change in campaign strategy: with the growing necessity of digital campaigning — the Tories' targeted ads playing a key role in their success.
> now, clear messaging, strong leadership, and digital campaigning is necessary in electoral campaigns.

## 2024 — Starmer

### Overview
The 2024 general election too place amid economic challenge, a struggling NHS post-COVID, and wide public dissatisfaction with the Conservative government after 14 years. The Tories had an extremely damaged image, and Labour were not obviously crap: they were positioning themselves as a trustworthy, steady and economically responsible party.
![Pasted image 20260107104417.png](/img/user/05%20-%20Images/1.1/Pasted%20image%2020260107104417.png)
### Factors
#### Policy and campaigning
Labour had policies focussed on — essentially — being 'not the Tories'
- increased funding for the NHS, education and policing
- addressing income inequality with progressive taxation
- firm commitment to net-zero by 2050
Starmer highlighted integrity, practical solutions, and not being the Conservative party. Their strategy included traditional media and digital platforms to engage with all kinds of voters.

The Tories faced significant obstacles during the campaign: criticism over austerity, cuts to public services, internal divisions, ongoing scandals, and the party's tendency towards regicide. They attempted to promote:
- economic stability
- achievement with Brexit
But they completely and utterly failed: especially with younger voters after a few controversial failed policies whilst in government (national service, mandatory maths A-Level.)

#### Context
The Tories were hated country-wide after party-gate and Liz Truss crashing the economy and the B in Boris standing for Bastard.
#### Social factors
Classes went back to being aligned, reversing Conservative inroads of 2019. Middle-class voters in particular shifted to Labour.

Many voters switched party, defying party loyalties: especially with Tory voters switching to Reform.

Labour is still strongly supported among ethnic minorities, although they lost a few seats to independents in Muslim-majority areas over Gaza.

Labour had a resurgence in Scotland, whilst the Lib-Dems capitalised on Tory losses in the south of England.

### Outcome

Turnout was 60% — lowest since 2001.

Labour won 33.7% of the vote and got a majority of +174: 411 seats.

The Conservative party won 23.7% of the vote in a historic collapse, and 121 seats.

The Lib Dems got 12.2% of the vote and 72 seats.

Reform UK got 14.3% of the vote and 5 seats.

This marked a significant swing, with Labour gaining 211 seats and Conservatives losing 251.
