## Class
### Socio-economic class
This refers to the categorisation of people based on income, occupation, and social status. Traditionally, these have been working, middle, and upper class. However, nowadays it is much more complicated.

In the UK, classes are now grouped as:
1. AB: Higher managerial/professional roles
2. C1: lower managerial/professional roles
3. C2: skilled manual workers
4. DE: semi-skilled and unskilled workers, unemployed, or retired
Obviously, the job descriptions for all of these can be very inaccurate when determining class. It's a generalist approach, not a 100% correct one. 

Socio-economic class historically played a large role in voting behaviour. The commonly held views on how class affects voting behaviour are as follows:
- Labour appeals to C2DE voters because it appeals to the working class by funding a welfare state and supporting worker's rights
- Conservatives appeal to ABC1 voters because their policies favour low taxes and businesses
Nowadays, these assumptions aren't really correct for multiple reasons.

### Factors associated with class alignment of voters

| Factor                         | Explanation                                                                                                                                                          | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                      | Why it can not have an impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Class identification**       | a.k.a class conciousness — how one's sense of belonging to a class can influence voting behaviour.                                                                   | In 2019, some working-class Leave/Labour voters felt neglected by Labour, contributing to Tory gain.                                                                                          | Class identification has weakened due to broader societal changes, including globalisation (hard to think you're doing crap when you see mass genocide/starvation.)                                                                                                                                          |
| **Class dealignment**          | refers to weakening of traditional associations between class and party — leading to greater electoral volatility.                                                   | In 2019, Tories attracted C2 voters by focusing on Brexit. In 2024, Labour attracted Tory-leaning middle-class voters because of economic dissatisfaction transcending class identity.        | While it provides opportunity for change, parties still rely on traditional bases. Although class dealignment was prominent in 2019 for Labour, they won them back in 2024, demonstrating that this is volatile.                                                                                             |
| **Partisan dealignment**       | refers to weakening of voter loyalty to specific parties — leading to an increase in floating voters.                                                                | Tories winning in 'Red Wall' constituencies in 2019, rise in Issue-Based voting (Labour on cost of living in 2024), rise in smaller parties, more tactical voting in marginal constituencies. | it seems like this has an incredible impact. Lower party membership across the board, broad dissatisfaction with Labour and the Conservatives... yeah. Although, with membership of the Greens soaring, who knows?                                                                                           |
| **Class polarisation**         | refers to an increasing divide in voting behaviour **between** socio-economic classes, often tied to broader social inequalities.                                    | Wealthier voters vote more Tory in time of economic disparity. In 2024, Labour's focus on taxing private schools was seen as a signal to working class voters.                                | other factors often override these divides. The 2019 general election, Brexit cut across class lines.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Working-class conservatism** | refers to the tendency of some working class individuals to vote conservative, often due to concerns of economic stability, social values, or for the 'classy' vibe. | In 2019, many Red Wall voters shifted to Tory over frustration with Labour's Brexit stance. Also, Boris promised 'levelling up.'                                                              | If the Tories fail to deliver on promises or new issues emerge (cost-of-living-crisis), the working class voters may shift back to Labour or other parties.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Embourgeoisement**           | refers to individuals from working class backgrounds experiencing upwards social mobility, which often changes their voting behaviour.                               | In 2019, embourgeoisement was evident in suburban constituencies where aspirational voters supported Conservative tax and homeownership policies.                                             | social mobility has slowed in recent years, and many who do move still prioritise issues like the environment or welfare, which aligns more with left-wing parties. In 2024, Labour gained with younger, educated voters who benefited from social mobility but were still concerned about the above issues. |

## Age

Age is goddamn significant, even today.
- younger voters tend to vote Labour
	- in 2019, Labour had a 43-point lead among voters aged 18-24
- older voters tend to vote Tory.
	- in 2019, the Tories had a 47-point lead among 65+

This precedent (but not the existence of patterns in age groups) shifted in 2024.
- Labour still had strong youth support, but their vote share in the 18-24 demographic decreased 21-points compared to 2019
	- with the Greens getting a 16-point rise, and
	- Labour's vote share in the 45+ age group increasing
- The Tory vote declined across all age groups in 2024.
	- they still performed better among older voters.
		- which is crucial when older voters have **significantly higher turnout**

## Gender

The influence of gender is much more nuanced than other factors. It changes and is influenced by other factors.
- historically, women were slightly more Tory than men — particularly post-war — due to Tory policy on family values and economic stability.
- men were more likely Labour voters, because they were the workers.
	- however, in this century, women are more likely to vote Labour.
	- although overall, there is little difference in gender and voting behaviour of gender tends to reflect larger patterns rather than inform them.

**Gendered voting in 2019**
- Conservatives got a larger share of the male vote compared to Labour (46% compared to 31%), probably due to campaigning focussed on Brexit and the economy
- Labour performed slightly better among women (35% compared to 44%)

**Gendered voting in 2024**
- Labour made significant gains among female voters, particularly in urban areas and younger populations.
- Tory appeal remained relatively strong among older male voters

## Region

Economic disparities, cultural values, and demographic composition varies widely across Great Britain — so it makes sense that there are voting behaviour differences.

### Major differences
#### The North-South divide
The North was typically a Labour hold ('Red Wall'), although that has shifted in recent elections.
> This is partly because of deindustrialisation and dissatisfaction with Labour

- 2019: Tories won seats which had been Labour strongholds for decades
- 2024: Labour regained some of these, but Tories maintained a presence in affluent northern suburbs

#### South of England
Outside of London, the South has traditionally been very conservative, reflecting higher average wealth and lifestyle. Labour and the Lib-Dems have, however, made inroads in areas with shifting demographics and concerns over public services and housing.
- 2024: Labour gained seats in commuter towns like Reading, driven by younger, middle-class voters concerned about housing and the economy.

#### Scotland
Scotland's political landscape is very different; shaped by nationalist sentiment and devolved issues.
- since 2015, the SNP has dominated because of their pro-independence support and dissatisfaction with Labour: who up until then had quite a good grip on many Scottish seats.
	- 2019: SNP won 48/59 seats
	- 2024: Labour emerged as the largest party in Scotland for the first time since 2010, due to disillusionment with the SNP's handling of domestic issues, and diminishing momentum for independence.

#### Wales
Typically a Labour stronghold, but there is growing support for Plaid Cymru
- 2019: Labour suffered losses in seats to the Tories
- 2024: Labour regained seats by focussing on public investment and infrastructure, Plaid Cymru retained it's influence in Welsh-speaking rural areas - but struggled to go beyond it's base.

#### Rural v. Urban
Urban areas are overwhelmingly Labour due to their younger, more diverse populations and priorities of public transport, housing and climate change.
- London: Labour maintained dominance in 2024, especially from ethnic minority groups and progressive voters
- other cities: Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham continued to be Labour strongholds

Rural areas lean conservative, reflecting an older population and priorities such as low taxation and agriculture.
- 2019: Tories maintained their hold on rural areas in England and Wales
- 2024: rural areas remained steadfastly conservative despite Labour gains nationally.

### Case study

Regional voting patterns are deeply rooted but not immune to shifting.

>[!EXAMPLE] Independent wins and the role of Palestine in the 2024 election
> 2024 was great for Labour, who gained nationally. However, in a few constituencies, independent candidates unexpectedly won: often at Labour's expense. A notable reason was the issue of Palestine, which was a big issue in these constituencies with significant Muslim populations or strong connections to international justice movements.
> 
> the independents who capitalised on this issue often framed their campaigns as a response to Labour's perceived inadequacy on that issue.
> > For example, Shokat Adam got a shock victory in Leicester South due to his stance on Palestine.


## Ethnicity

Labour dominates among ethnic minorities, but this isn't uniform across groups.

![Ethnic minorities.png](/img/user/05%20-%20Images/Ethnic%20minorities.png)


## Turnout

Turnout stayed consistently high post-war and peaked at 80% in 1950, reflecting strong partly loyalty.

However, from the 1990s -> now, turnout has been declining. This is linked to:
- voter apathy
- widespread political disillusionment
- not voting in an election when it seemed one party would win

### Turnout in 2024
 Turnout was 60%, marking a decline and lowest turnout since 2001. This was because:
 - public disillusionment
 - election fatigue (from the many tumultuous elections and referendums)
 - demographic variation
	 - lower turnout among youths and economically disadvantaged groups, who feel politically alienated more often
- Voter apathy because of:
	- lack of impact in voting — especially in safe seats
	- distrust in politicians
	- generational and economic disparities
