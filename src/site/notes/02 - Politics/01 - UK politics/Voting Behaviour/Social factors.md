## Class
### Socio-economic class
This refers to the categorisation of people based on income, occupation, and social status. Traditionally, these have been working, middle, and upper class. However, nowadays it is much more complicated.

In the UK, classes are now grouped as:
1. AB: Higher managerial/professional roles
2. C1: lower managerial/professional roles
3. C2: skilled manual workers
4. DE: semi-skilled and unskilled workers, unemployed, or retired
Obviously, the job descriptions for all of these can be very inaccurate when determining class. It's a generalist approach, not a 100% correct one. 

Socio-economic class historically played a large role in voting behaviour. The commonly held views on how class affects voting behaviour are as follows:
- Labour appeals to C2DE voters because it appeals to the working class by funding a welfare state and supporting worker's rights
- Conservatives appeal to ABC1 voters because their policies favour low taxes and businesses
Nowadays, these assumptions aren't really correct for multiple reasons.

### Factors associated with class alignment of voters

| Factor                         | Explanation                                                                                                                                                          | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                      | Why it can not have an impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Class identification**       | a.k.a class conciousness — how one's sense of belonging to a class can influence voting behaviour.                                                                   | In 2019, some working-class Leave/Labour voters felt neglected by Labour, contributing to Tory gain.                                                                                          | Class identification has weakened due to broader societal changes, including globalisation (hard to think you're doing crap when you see mass genocide/starvation.)                                                                                                                                          |
| **Class dealignment**          | refers to weakening of traditional associations between class and party — leading to greater electoral volatility.                                                   | In 2019, Tories attracted C2 voters by focusing on Brexit. In 2024, Labour attracted Tory-leaning middle-class voters because of economic dissatisfaction transcending class identity.        | While it provides opportunity for change, parties still rely on traditional bases. Although class dealignment was prominent in 2019 for Labour, they won them back in 2024, demonstrating that this is volatile.                                                                                             |
| **Partisan dealignment**       | refers to weakening of voter loyalty to specific parties — leading to an increase in floating voters.                                                                | Tories winning in 'Red Wall' constituencies in 2019, rise in Issue-Based voting (Labour on cost of living in 2024), rise in smaller parties, more tactical voting in marginal constituencies. | it seems like this has an incredible impact. Lower party membership across the board, broad dissatisfaction with Labour and the Conservatives... yeah. Although, with membership of the Greens soaring, who knows?                                                                                           |
| **Class polarisation**         | refers to an increasing divide in voting behaviour **between** socio-economic classes, often tied to broader social inequalities.                                    | Wealthier voters vote more Tory in time of economic disparity. In 2024, Labour's focus on taxing private schools was seen as a signal to working class voters.                                | other factors often override these divides. The 2019 general election, Brexit cut across class lines.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Working-class conservatism** | refers to the tendency of some working class individuals to vote conservative, often due to concerns of economic stability, social values, or for the 'classy' vibe. | In 2019, many Red Wall voters shifted to Tory over frustration with Labour's Brexit stance. Also, Boris promised 'levelling up.'                                                              | If the Tories fail to deliver on promises or new issues emerge (cost-of-living-crisis), the working class voters may shift back to Labour or other parties.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Embourgeoisement**           | refers to individuals from working class backgrounds experiencing upwards social mobility, which often changes their voting behaviour.                               | In 2019, embourgeoisement was evident in suburban constituencies where aspirational voters supported Conservative tax and homeownership policies.                                             | social mobility has slowed in recent years, and many who do move still prioritise issues like the environment or welfare, which aligns more with left-wing parties. In 2024, Labour gained with younger, educated voters who benefited from social mobility but were still concerned about the above issues. |

## Age

Age is goddamn significant, even today.
- younger voters tend to vote Labour
	- in 2019, Labour had a 43-point lead among voters aged 18-24
- older voters tend to vote Tory.
	- in 2019, the Tories had a 47-point lead among 65+

This precedent (but not the existence of patterns in age groups) shifted in 2024.
- Labour still had strong youth support, but their vote share in the 18-24 demographic decreased 21-points compared to 2019
	- with the Greens getting a 16-point rise, and
	- Labour's vote share in the 45+ age group increasing
- The Tory vote declined across all age groups in 2024.
	- they still performed better among older voters.
		- which is crucial when older voters have **significantly higher turnout**
