> Why are there barely any notes here?

Because if you get a question on the lib-dems in your A-level Politics paper, your first thought should not be whatever information you've memorised on the lib-dems, but to phone up Edexcel to ask who wrote that question in order to let Edexcel know that at least one of their employees has been doing drugs on company time.
> Note several months after — I've done more notes on the lib-dems, because if a question on all major parties comes up, you do have to talk about these irrelevant sods.

## More detailed notes
### Origin story
The Liberal Democrats were formed in 1987 though the merging of the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party, the latter of which had broken away from Labour in 181. between 1983 and 1987, the two parties worked closely together under an alliance, but this was little more than an arrangement for fighting general elections.

### Ideology
The Lib Dems have a range of ideological traditions that they draw on because of their origin.

Although they are most clearly associated with liberalism, this encompasses both the [[02 - Politics/04 - Ideologies/Liberalism/Classical Liberalism\|classical liberal]] belief in a minimal state and the free market — reminiscent of economic Thatcherism —  and a [[02 - Politics/04 - Ideologies/Liberalism/Modern liberal consolidation\|modern liberal]] belief in social and economic intervention in order to deliver the [[02 - Politics/04 - Ideologies/Liberalism/junk/Modern Liberalism#Positive freedom\|freedom]] that is needed for individuals to grow and flourish.

Both traditions are united in their belief in [[02 - Politics/04 - Ideologies/Liberalism/Individualism\|Individualism]] and [[02 - Politics/04 - Ideologies/Liberalism/Liberty\|Liberty]], favouring equal rights and equality of opportunity, a tolerant society that celebrates diversity, and limited government, where the relationship between people and state is defined in a constitution.

In foreign policy, the Lib Dems come together around a liberal internationalist approach that places working through global institutions (such as the UN) to tackle global issues like climate change and human rights abuses.

#### Centre Left
During electoral terms, the Lib Dems set out to 'break the mould of British politics,' by providing a centrist alternative agenda. However, in ideological terms, they were generally viewed as a centre-left party, based around a [[02 - Politics/04 - Ideologies/Liberalism/junk/Modern Liberalism#Keynesian economics\|Keynesian economic approach]], and a larger role for the state to play in delivering equality of opportunity. This emphasised the need for the state to deliver a minimum standard of living.

Such trends were reflected during the Labour years in power (1997->2010) in their commitment to increase income tax by one penny in the pound, in order to better fund education and to abolish tuition fees for Uni students, as well as their opposition to the Iraq war, which started in 2003.

#### Centre Right
In light of their previous commitments, their choice to join a coalition with the Conservatives was surprising. Nevertheless, shifts in their views in the run-up to the 2010 General Election provided an ideological basis for the coalition.

Associated with *The Orange Book* (2004) — which contained significant contributions from Nick Clegg and David Laws, there was growing support within the Lib Dems for a freer market, and free trade economic strategy. This shifted them from centre-left to centre-right.

### The modern Liberal Democrats
#### Economy
They unite around the idea that individuals who work hard and contribute to society should have good, fulfilling, and well-paid jobs, while businesses and entrepreneurs who are creative, invest in their workforce, and behave responsibly to their employees and to the environment should be supported.

##### Centre-right influences
The Lib-Dems entered the 2019 election with the toughest rules on government borrowing as an attempt to position themselves as the strongest party on public finances. The party stated it would run a 1% surplus on current spending, meaning the money spent on public services would be lower than the amount raised in taxes.

##### Centre-left influences
Targeted tax rises would be used to pay for spending commitments to improve public services & tackle climate change, in order to deliver equality of opportunity for all. this included one penny in the pound extra on income tax, corporation tax increases and a tax on frequent flyers.

They also proposed a 20% minimum wage boost for those on zero hours contracts, in order to make the work pay properly and decrease the use of that business practice.

##### In 2024
- Develop an industrial strategy to create greater level of certainty for business to help encourage investment. 
- Develop a 'commercial landowner levy' to replace business rates.


#### Welfare
They are united around the belief in delivering welfare that supports people in the hardest of times, and that delivers equal opportunities across the country.

##### Centre-right influences
Responsible welfare spending, where all additional spending is paid for by additional tax rises.

##### Centre-left influences
An extra £7bn per year for health and social care, which would come from the income tax rise.

Free childcare for all children aged 2-4, paid for by the corporation tax rise.

##### In 2024
- Protect the triple-lock on pensions. 
- Develop a National Food Strategy to tackle rising food costs. 
- Double statutory maternity and shared parental pay. 
- Scrap the benefit cap and remove the two-child limit.


#### Law and order
They are united in the idea that a law and order policy involves taking preventative measures to stop crime.

##### Centre-right influences
An extra £1bn per year for policing, placing two new police officers in every council ward in the UK.

##### Centre-left influences
They emphasise community policing that prevents crime, investing in local services that help people build lives free from crime, and focusing on rehabilitation in prisons to prevent re-offending.

They also want to legalise cannabis, to break the grip of criminal gangs that make their money from the illegal drugs trade.

##### In 2024
- a legal guarantee that police will attend and investigate all burglaries
- improve rehabilitation services to reduce reoffending
- make misogyny a hate crime, and ensure that the police are fully resourced to prosecute all hate crimes.

#### Foreign policy
The lib-dems believe in international liberalism, and want the UK to play an active role in building a better world by working with and through international institutions such as the EU, UN and the World Trade Organization to tackle global issues like climate change and human rights abuses. This was the cornerstone of their opposition to the Iraq war. Although the party was opposed to a like-for-like renewal of the UK's nuclear deterrent in 2010, they have moved to a position of maintaining a minimum nuclear deterrent.

On Brexit, they were united in opposition to it, and trying to stop it. Their 2019 manifesto commitment to reverse Brexit was the centrepiece of their campaign. However, following 3 heavy defeats in elections in a row, Ed Davey in 2020 looked to move the party beyond the issue, claiming it will now campaign for closer ties with the EU, not a full rejoin.

##### In 2024 
- focus on reducing trade barriers with other countries
- continue to support Ukraine against Russia
- call for a bilateral ceasefire in the Middle East and recognition of a Palestinian state
- improve relations with the EU, with the aim of rejoining the single market
