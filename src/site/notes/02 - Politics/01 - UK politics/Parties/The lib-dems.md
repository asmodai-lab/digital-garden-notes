> Why are there barely any notes here?

Because if you get a question on the lib-dems in your A-level Politics paper, your first thought should not be whatever information you've memorised on the lib-dems, but to phone up Edexcel to ask who wrote that question in order to let Edexcel know that at least one of their employees has been doing drugs on company time.
> Note several months after — I've done more notes on the lib-dems, because if a question on all major parties comes up, you do have to talk about these irrelevant sods.

## More detailed notes
### Origin story
The Liberal Democrats were formed in 1987 though the merging of the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party, the latter of which had broken away from Labour in 181. between 1983 and 1987, the two parties worked closely together under an alliance, but this was little more than an arrangement for fighting general elections.

### Ideology
The Lib Dems have a range of ideological traditions that they draw on because of their origin.

Although they are most clearly associated with liberalism, this encompasses both the [[02 - Politics/04 - Ideologies/Liberalism/Classical Liberalism\|classical liberal]] belief in a minimal state and the free market — reminiscent of economic Thatcherism —  and a [[02 - Politics/04 - Ideologies/Liberalism/Modern liberal consolidation\|modern liberal]] belief in social and economic intervention in order to deliver the [[02 - Politics/04 - Ideologies/Liberalism/Modern Liberalism#Positive freedom\|freedom]] that is needed for individuals to grow and flourish.

Both traditions are united in their belief in [[02 - Politics/04 - Ideologies/Liberalism/Individualism\|Individualism]] and [[02 - Politics/04 - Ideologies/Liberalism/Liberty\|Liberty]], favouring equal rights and equality of opportunity, a tolerant society that celebrates diversity, and limited government, where the relationship between people and state is defined in a constitution.

In foreign policy, the Lib Dems come together around a liberal internationalist approach that places working through global institutions (such as the UN) to tackle global issues like climate change and human rights abuses.

#### Centre Left
During electoral terms, the Lib Dems set out to 'break the mould of British politics,' by providing a centrist alternative agenda. However, in ideological terms, they were generally viewed as a centre-left party, based around a [[02 - Politics/04 - Ideologies/Liberalism/Modern Liberalism#Keynesian economics\|Keynesian economic approach]], and a larger role for the state to play in delivering equality of opportunity. This emphasised the need for the state to deliver a minimum standard of living.

Such trends were reflected during the Labour years in power (1997->2010) in their commitment to increase income tax by one penny in the pound, in order to better fund education and to abolish tuition fees for Uni students, as well as their opposition to the Iraq war, which started in 2003.

#### Centre Right
In light of their previous commitments, their choice to join a coalition with the Conservatives was surprising. Nevertheless, shifts in their views in the run-up to the 2010 General Election provided an ideological basis for the coalition.

Associated with *The Orange Book* (2004) — which contained significant contributions from Nick Clegg and David Laws, there was growing support within the Lib Dems for a freer market, and free trade economic strategy. This shifted them from centre-left to centre-right.
