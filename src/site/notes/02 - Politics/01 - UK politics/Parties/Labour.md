# History of Labour policy

## Old Labour

Established in 1900 to represent the interests of the working class.
	Although it's membership has included Marxists, it has never been a Marxist party.
Labour has traditionally been a compromise between **democratic socialism** and **social democracy.** 

**Democratic Socialists** believe that the capitalist state will inevitably be replaced by a socialist state as the working class achieves political power.

**Social Democrats** believe that a more socially just and equal society can be achieved by reforming existing capitalist structures. 

> The core of Labour's socialist ideology is the principle of collectivism, where we achieve more by working together for the common good than by competing for our own interests. 
> Labour have sought to do this by:
> 	Nationalization of key industries
> 	Redistributive taxation
> 	Supporting an extensive welfare state 
> 	Fostering close links since trade unions- since they both aimed to protect the interests of the working class. 

### The first Labour government
The first Labour majority government was run by Clement Atlee from 1945-51. 
- In 1948, they introduced the National Health Service
- Approximately 20% of the economy was nationalized, including steel, electricity, and coal — as well as the Bank of England.  

### The Wilson Ministry

- In 1965, the deputy PM announced a National Plan for economic growth that would expand the economy by 25% by 1970
- It was a maintenance grant to make it easier for young poor people to attend university
- The open university was established to further open higher education to those from poorer backgrounds
- Wilson's governments also committed to the expansion of comprehensive education at the expense of grammar schools.
- Acts of parliament against discrimination were passed:
	- Race Relations Act 1968, which made discrimination in the workplace illegal
	- Sex Discrimination Act 1975
- To pay for a welfare state, taxes on the wealthier increased dramatically. The top rate of taxation was 83%


# New Labour

> In the 1979 general election, James Callaghan was defeated by the Conservative Party led by Margaret Thatcher. Following the election of Michael Foot as Labour leader in 1980, the party moved decisively to the left. In the 1983 general election Labour’s manifesto committed the party to further nationalisation, increased taxation of the wealthier in society, withdrawal from the European Economic Community and unilateral nuclear disarmament. One Labour MP, Gerald Kaufman, famously referred to the manifesto as ‘the longest suicide note in history’ and Labour’s share of the vote collapsed from 36.9% in 1979 to 27.6% in the 1983 general election, handing Thatcher a landslide victory.
> - The scale of the 1983 general election defeat shocked Labour into abandoning its most socialist policies and, under the leadership of Neil Kinnock (1983–92) and John Smith (1992–94), Labour moved towards the centre.

Then TONY FUCKING BLAIR WAS ELECTED. 

## The third way
Blair loved the 'third way' principles developed by Anthony Giddens. 

According to Giddens, the third way represented a compromise between the extreme socialism and capitalism. It argued that Labour governments should not commit to ideological commitments such as nationalisation, redistributive taxation, class conflict, collectivism and equality.

Instead, Labour should focus on the establishment of a 'stakeholder society', based on the principles of inclusion and communitarianism. 
- Essentially, enacting policies that encourage:
	- Wealth creation rather than wealth distribution
	- Loosening ties with trade unions
	- Social justice within a capitalist economy.
Blair modified the Labour party constitution in 1995 so that the party abandoned its commitment to nationalisation and accepted the economic benefits of a free-market economy. 

The left wing of the party fucking hated him.

Here's what he did:
- Kept the top tax rate at 40% as established by Thatcher, because 'the wealthiest in society are wealth creators' (bruh)
- The state was an enabler, not a provider. State schools were given greater independence and tuition fees were introduced so that students contributed to the cost of higher education
- Introduced tough laws such as 'anti-social behaviour orders' (ASBOs) to combat crime
- Constitutional modernisation-
	- Removing most hereditary peers
	- Incorporating the ECHR
	- Establishing the Supreme Court
	- Devolution
- Introduced a minimum wage, and increased spending on public services.

>  When Blair resigned in 2007, Brown became PM. In response to the 2008 economic crisis, he introduced a 50 pence top rate of taxation on incomes over £150, 000, as well as a bank bailout programme.
> His successor, Ed Miliband, maintained it's distancing from Blairite policy by committing to the 50 p top rate of taxation, demanding an energy price freeze, and drawing a distinction between 'predatory' finance capitalism and 'producers' in the industry.
