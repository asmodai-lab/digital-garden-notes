# History of Labour policy

## Old Labour

Established in 1900 to represent the interests of the working class.
	Although it's membership has included <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Marxists</span>, it has never been a<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> Marxist party</span>.
Labour has traditionally been a compromise between **democratic socialism** and **social democracy.** 

**Democratic Socialists** believe that the capitalist state will inevitably be replaced by a socialist state as the working class achieves political power.

**Social Democrats** believe that a more socially just and equal society can be achieved by reforming existing capitalist structures. 

> The core of Labour's socialist ideology is the<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> principle of collectivism</span>, where we achieve more by working together for the<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> common good</span> than by competing for our own interests. 
> Labour have sought to do this by:
> 	<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Nationalization of key industries<br>> 	Redistributive taxation<br>> 	Supporting an extensive welfare state <br>> 	Fostering close links since trade unions- since they both aimed to protect the interests of the working class</span>. 

### The first Labour government
The first Labour majority government was run by <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Clement Atlee</span> from<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> 1945-51. </span>
- In<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> 1948, </span>they introduced the<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> National Health Service</span>
- Approximately<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> 20% </span>of the<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> economy was nationalized</span>, including <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">steel</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">electricity</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">coal</span> — as well as the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Bank of England.</span>  

### The Wilson Ministry

- In <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">1965</span>, the deputy PM announced a<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> National Plan for economic growth</span> that would<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> expand the economy</span> by<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> 25% by 1970</span>
- It was a <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">maintenance grant</span> to make it<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> easier</span> for<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> young poor people</span> to<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> attend university</span>
- The <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">open university was established</span> to<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> further open higher education</span> to those from<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> poorer </span>backgrounds
- Wilson's governments also committed to the<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> expansion of comprehensive education</span> at the expense of grammar schools.
- Acts of parliament against discrimination were passed:
	- <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Race Relations Act 1968</span>, which made discrimination in the workplace illegal
	- <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Sex Discrimination Act 1975</span>
- To pay for a welfare state, <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">taxes</span> on the <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">wealthier increased dramatically</span>. The top rate of taxation was 83%


# New Labour

> In the 1979 general election, <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">James Callaghan</span> was <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">defeated by the Conservative Party led by Margaret Thatcher.</span> Following the election of <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Michael Foot</span> as<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> Labour leader</span> in <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">1980</span>, the party <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">moved</span> decisively<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> to the left</span>. In the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">1983 general election</span><span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> Labour’s manifesto</span> committed the party to <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">further nationalisation</span>, <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">increased taxation</span> of the<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> wealthier</span> in society, <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">withdrawal</span> from the <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">European Economic Community</span> and<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> unilateral nuclear disarmament</span>. One Labour MP, <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Gerald Kaufman</span>, famously referred to the manifesto as ‘the longest suicide note in history’ and <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Labour’s share of the vote</span> collapsed from<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> 36.9% in 1979 to 27.6% in the 1983 general election</span>, handing <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Thatcher</span> a landslide victory.
> - The scale of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">1983 general election defeat</span> shocked <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Labour</span> into <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">abandoning its most socialist policies</span> and, under the leadership of <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Neil Kinnock</span> (1983–92) and<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> John Smith</span> (1992–94),<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)"> Labour </span>moved<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> towards the centre.</span>

Then<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> TONY</span> FUCKING<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> BLAIR</span> WAS ELECTED. 

## The third way
Blair loved the<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> 'third way'</span> principles developed by Anthony Giddens. 

According to Giddens, the third way represented a <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">compromise</span> between the<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> extreme socialism</span> and <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">capitalism.</span> It argued that Labour governments <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">should not commit</span> to ideological commitments such as<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> nationalisation</span>,<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> redistributive taxation</span>, <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">class conflict</span>, <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">collectivism</span> and <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">equality</span>.

Instead, Labour should focus on the establishment of a <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">'stakeholder society'</span>, based on the principles of inclusion and <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">communitarianism. </span>
- Essentially, enacting policies that encourage:
	- <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">Wealth creation </span>rather than wealth distribution
	- <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">Loosening ties with trade unions</span>
	- Social justice within a<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> capitalist economy.</span>
<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Blair modified the Labour party constitution in 1995</span> so that the party<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> abandoned its commitment to nationalisation</span> and <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">accepted the economic benefits of a free-market economy. </span>

The left wing of the party fucking hated him.

Here's what he did:
- Kept the <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">top tax rate at 40%</span> as established by <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Thatcher,</span> because<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> 'the wealthiest in society are wealth creators'</span> (bruh)
- The state was an<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> enabler, not a provider. </span>State schools were given<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> greater independence</span> and <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">tuition fees were introduced</span> so that students contributed to the cost of higher education
- Introduced tough laws such as <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">'anti-social behaviour orders' (ASBOs)</span> to combat crime
- Constitutional modernisation-
	- <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Removing most hereditary peers</span>
	- <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Incorporating the ECHR</span>
	- <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Establishing the Supreme Court</span>
	- <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Devolution</span>
- <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Introduced a minimum wage</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">increased spending on public services.<br></span>
>  When Blair resigned in 2007, Brown became PM. In response to the 2008 economic crisis, he introduced a 50 pence top rate of taxation on incomes over £150, 000, as well as a bank bailout programme.
> His successor, Ed Miliband, maintained it's distancing from Blairite policy by committing to the 50 p top rate of taxation, demanding an energy price freeze, and drawing a distinction between 'predatory' finance capitalism and 'producers' in the industry.
