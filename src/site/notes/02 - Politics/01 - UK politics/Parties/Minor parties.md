### The SNP
#### Economy
Firm opponent of austerity, arguing that the government should reverse the spending cuts that began in 2010. 

They also would like power over employment rights to be devolved to them, which they would use to boost the minimum wage and protect those on insecure contracts.

Standing apart from dominant parties in 2019, the SNP argued for the scrapping of the Trident nuclear armed submarine system (currently located in Scottish waters), which would free up tens of billions of pounds to be spend on public services and conventional armed forces

#### Welfare
The SNP would like more powers over welfare to be devolved to them, and would like to scrap the roll-out of universal credit and reverse many of the benefit cuts introduced since 2010.

They would also like to see an increase in healthcare spending and a bill to prevent further privatisation of the NHS.

#### Law and order
Their focus is on their own performance — pointing to the fact that, since coming to power, a further 1000 officers were recruited. 

A key focus has been persuading Westminster to scrap VAT for emergency services in Scotland, to bring it inline with England and Wales, and to refund the £175m in VAT back to Scotland.

#### Foreign policy

They were very against Brexit, and they supported a second referendum in 2019. They also argued that Brexit should have triggered a second Scottish Independence vote.

### The UK independence party and the Brexit party
#### Events
The UK Independence party was founded in 1993 by the Anti-Federalist League — a cross-party organisation founded to campaign against the Maastricht treaty.

UKIP emerged as the leading right-wing Eurosceptic party following the dissolution of the Referendum Party in '97. Despite internal power struggles and leadership changes, the party made steady electoral progress. Having gained 3 seats in the 1999 European Parliament election, UKIP came third with 12 MEPs in 2004 and second with 13 MEPs in 2009. Its major electoral breakthrough came with the 2014 European elections, becoming the largest UK party with 24 MEPs. 

However, they've struggled to make inroads in general elections, with it's highest in 2015 with 12.6% of the vote and only 1 seat.

#### Significance
At the heart of their ideology was the desire to strengthen national identity against the threats of EU membership and immigration. These have been seen as linked issues, on the grounds that increased immigration into the UK — particularly since the early 2000s — has stemmed, in significant part, from the joint impact of the EU's enlargement into Eastern Europe and the organisation's commitment to 'freedom of movement.'

Nevertheless, the achievement of the goal to leave the EU through the Brexit referendum posed a threat to UKIP: by depriving it of it's purpose, and forcing the Tories to join them in supporting Brexit. In these circumstances, UKIP attempted to remain distinctive by championing 'hard' Brexit— emphasising the need for the UK to regain full control over it's own borders.

Following the collapse of their vote in 2017, the Brexit party was launched in 2019 with Nigel Farage at its centre, to ensure the UK left the EU and to change UK politics for good.

Its core philosophy was to give the UK back control over its borders, laws and money, to challenge the 2-party system, and to restore trust in democracy. In 2019, they got 29 MEPs in the EU Parliament, more than Labour and the Tories combined. 

Later in 2019, the party stated it wouldn't put any candidates forward for the 2019 GE in seats won by the Tories in 2017 to give the Tories a chance to win a majority. They won 2% of the vote and no seats, and the Tories got a comfortable majority.

Nigel Farage claimed the Party has 'killed the Lib Dems and hurt the Labour Party.' In some Leave seats — such as North West Durham — the Labour vote dropped considerably, with some of those votes moving to the Brexit Party, allowing a conservative candidate to win.

However, somewhat unexpectedly in 38 of the seats that Labour won, the combined Tory and Brexit Party vote was larger than the Labour vote, suggesting that the Brexit Party split the Leave vote, saving Labour from further losses.
