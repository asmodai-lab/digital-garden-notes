## History of conservative ideas

### Traditional conservatism

> this emerged in the 1600's. It's based around the idea of wanting **stability** above all else. 
> 	This means no violence, stable economy, and avoiding a revolution by appeasing the peasants (lol)- A.K.A keep things the same at all times. 

### One-nation conservatism

>Founded by <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Benjamin Disraeli.</span>
>	He thought that conservatism must <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">unite</span> the nation in reverence for<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> traditions </span>and<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> institutions</span> that made Britain great.

>	This led to conservatives supporting extensive social reforms (such as the welfare state.)
>		They became the most successful modern vote-winning political party and the main governing party most of the 20th century.

### The new right

		- Adam Smith referred to this as the<span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)"> 'invisible hand of the market</span>

> [!info] Liz Truss
> Truss' policies (specifically, cutting the rate of taxation) were credited to Thatcherite credentials. After all, in Howe's first budget, he drove down the top rate of income tax 83%->60% and the basic rate 33%->30%. However, Thatcher wasn't all tax-cuts; she definitely balanced the budget. A later Howe budget dramatically increased indirect taxes to drive down the deficit- in contrast to Truss' 2022 claim that it was the 'right time' for the government to borrow more.
> Kwarteng's 'give away budget'- which cut the base rate of income tax, removed the increase in national insurance and froze corporation tax-- had more in common with Heath's budgets than Thatcher's. 
> So although Truss may have come into office laying claim to Thatcher’s legacy, her policies had a distinctly Heath-ite flavour. Rishi Sunak's balancing of the budget was much truer to Thatcher's legacy.


## Modern Conservative policy

### The economy (one-nation/Thatcherite)

The Tories tend to flip-flop between one-nation and Thatcherite on the economy: even within the same government. 

-<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> Johnson's</span> government had<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> high public spending</span> to level up society. 
	- Public spending in<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> 2021</span> was <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">42% </span>of the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> economy</span>, on<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> par </span>with the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">1970s</span>
		- (although note that some of this was definitely COVID)
	- To finance increased spending, <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Chancellor Sunak </span><span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">significantly increased corporation tax</span> and<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> national insurance</span>
-<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> Truss</span>' government was... a fucking mess
- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Sunak's</span> government responded to the recession with higher taxes and<span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)"> dramatic cuts in public spending</span>- a very<span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)"> Thatcherite </span>thing.

### Welfare (one-nation/Thatcherite)

- When the <span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)">minimum wage</span> was introduced by Blair, <span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)">Tories</span> claimed it was<span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)"> unacceptable.</span>
- In Cameron's government, Chancellor Osborne introduced a <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">'living wage'</span> to provide<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> extra support</span> for the least well paid
- Johnson established a new secretary of state for<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> levelling up, housing and communities.</span>
	- But he also measurably<span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)"> privatised the NHS</span>
- Cameron, Truss, and Sunak all said that they were <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">committed to supporting the NHS.</span>
	- However, the Universal Credit system, which is based on<span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)"> more you earn= less you get in benefits</span> suggests <span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)">Thatcherism.</span>

### Law and order (Thatcherite)

- May passed the <span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)">'Investigatory Powers Act' (2016)</span> giving the government enhanced <span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)">powers</span> of <span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)">surveillance.</span>
- Johnson passed the <span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)">'Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act'</span> which<span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)"> increased police powers </span>over<span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)"> public protests.</span>
	- The home secretaries- Priti Patel and Suella Braverman, were both<span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)"> critics of liberalism..</span>

### Foreign policy (Thatcherite)

- Johnson negotiated<span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)"> Brexit.</span>
	- he also announced a <span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)">£16.5 billion increase to defence spending</span>, the biggest boost since the end of the Cold war
	- in 2021, the <span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)">UK joined (AUSUK)</span>, a defence alliance to counter China.
- Truss and Sunak were similarly hawkish- providing <span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)">strong opposition</span> to the<span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)"> Russian invasion of Ukraine,</span> and <span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)">criticising China</span> for it's <span style="color:rgb(181, 97, 245)">human rights record<br></span>
