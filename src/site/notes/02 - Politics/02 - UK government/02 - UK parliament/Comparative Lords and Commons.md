## History

Traditionally, the Lords was the dominant house in the legislature. However, it's now the Commons; because it is elected. 
- by convention, the leader of the party with the most seats in the commons has the option to form a govt. and the PM is expected to come from the Commons.
- Despite this, the Lords is still called the 'upper chamber'

### Developments before 2000

- [[02 - Politics/02 - UK government/02 - UK parliament/Comparative Lords and Commons#The Salisbury Convention\|The Salisbury Convention]], which was agreed upon between 1945-'51
- Life Peerages Act 1958 — created life peers
- House of Lords Act 1999 — removed all but 92 of the hereditary peers.

## Why is the Commons more powerful than the Lords?

### Legislation change

>Between **1909 and 1911**, a constitutional crisis emerged over refusal of the Lords to pass Chancellor David Lloyd George's **'people's budget**' (the precursor to the welfare state.)
>>This resulted in the passing of the **Parliament Act 1911**

> [!INFO] Parliament Act 1911
> This removed the power that the Lords had to block legislation, and limited their ability to delay legislation to two years
>>[!INFO] Parliament Act 1949
>>This delayed the **limitation to just one year**

- This means that if the Commons passes the same act for two consecutive parliamentary years, they can use the Parliament Act to bypass the Lords

**The Parliament Act has only been used on four occasions.**
1. **War Crimes Act 1991** — allowed UK courts to try suspected crimes committed on behalf of Nazi Germany during WW2
2. **European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999** — changed the voting system in the European Parliament Elections in the UK to proportional representation
3. **Sexual Offences Amendment 2000** — equalised the age of consent for homosexual sex to that of heterosexual sex.
4. **Hunting Act 2004** — prohibited the use of dogs in hunting wild mammals.

>[!TIP]
>Even though it's only been used 4 times, the very existence of the Parliament Act means that the Lords are **more likely to back down** rather than **risk being imposed** by the Commons.
>>[!EXAMPLE]
>>During the **EU notification of withdrawal Act 2017**, the Lords added two amendments which were overturned by the Commons. The Lords then backed down and withdrew the amendments

### Financial privilege

Finances are — **by convention** — entirely up to the Commons. 
- after the Chancellor presents the Budget, the Lords **(by convention)** do not vote against it.

### The Salisbury Convention

This dictates that the Lords do not vote against any bill formed in a government's election manifesto.
- this is because the manifesto is reasonably argued to have given the government their mandate, so it is reasonable to believe the passage of a bill from the manifesto is the expressed wish of the electorate.

>[!EXAMPLE]
>In 2025, the Football Governance Act was passed — which had been a manifesto commitment. In the manifesto, it said:
>	*"We will introduce a Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator to ensure financial sustainability of football clubs in England."*
>The bill went through all the stages in the Commons and Lords as normal — being debated in the Lords also. However, no vote was held in the Lords at the Second or Third Reading.

### Reasonable Time convention

An important convention in the Lords is that Govt. business will be considered in "reasonable time". The Govt. largely controls the Commons so can ensure that their business is priority — but this is not the case in the Lords.
- By convention, the Lords agree not to unreasonably delay Govt. business.

>[!EXAMPLE]
>In Labour's 2024 manifesto, they proposed to remove the remaining 92 hereditary peers. As such, they introduced the House of Lords Bill. 
>
>This was, for obvious reasons, controversial in the Lords. However, while amendments were suggested, no attempt was made to slow down the bill, as the Lords recognised the expectation that they should make good progress in their scrutiny — due to the Reasonable Time Convention

### Secondary Legislation

Secondary Legislation is law created by the Govt. under a previously passed Bill. It is essential in carryout out govt. functions: Parliament doesn't have the time to debate on every single issue/clarification.

While it is scrutinized by the Lords (through the *Secondary Legislation* *Scrutiny Committee*), by convention they only vote against it in 'exceptional circumstances.'

>[!EXAMPLE]
>Secondary legislation under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 might add a new drug to the list of proscribed substances.
>
>The most common form of Secondary Legislation is Statutory Instruments. ~3,500 are passed every year.

### The Great Offices of State

It is convention that the Great Offices of State (PM, Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary) will be Commons members/MPs.
- this is because it gives these offices legitimacy and allows more scrutiny.

>[!INFO]
>The last PM to govern coming from the Lords was the Marquess of Salisbury (1895-1902).
>> Although, In 1963, Alec Douglas-Home was chosen to succeed MacMillan. However, he was a Lord, not an MP. He renounced his peerage and stood for election to the Commons in a hastily created by-election (his cousin, a Conservative MP, was persuaded to resign.) He did govern from the Lords for 14 days.

>[!EXAMPLE]
>Until David Cameron became Foreign Secretary in Sunak's govt., the last Lord to hold one of the Great Offices was Lord Carrington (1979-1982), but he resigned in '82 citing the IMR convention for failing to recognise the Argentinian threat to the Falkland Islands.

### Other factors
#### Representative Function

Since the Commons is elected, it has greater legitimacy than the Lords. Although the Lords contains many respected figures, the fact that they cannot be held to account by the electorate reduces their mandate.

#### Media attention

As a result of the Commons being directly linked to constituencies, and it's containing the more significant political figures: the Commons gets more media attention
- PMQs gets far more attention than most other events of govt.
- MPs tend to have greater media presence — appearing in the news, political shows, or panel programs.

#### Location of Government

The vast majority of ministers are in the Commons. It's common sense that the Commons is more powerful, isn't it?
