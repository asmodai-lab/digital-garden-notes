## Sources of the UK Constitution

Since our Constitution is not codified, it's a bit harder to say what is and what isn't constitutional. There is, however, an easy way to tell:
> Does a law affect:
> 1. Power - who has power, how much power, etc
> 2. Rights - who has rights, which rights, which rights take primacy over others, etc
> 3. Changes - how does someone get power/lose power, how does someone significantly change the constitution, etc
> Also known as the People's Republic of China

### Statute law
These are Acts of Parliament that contribute to the constitution -- like the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, which established not only those specific constraints on the Lords, but also the principle that Parliament should reflect the will of the public.
> [!tldr] Statute law definition
> A parliamentary bill that has been approved by both houses of Parliament and then given royal assent. In the UK, there is no authority greater than statute law.
