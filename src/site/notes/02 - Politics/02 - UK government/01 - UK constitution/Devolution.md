## Scottish devolution

The Scottish Parliament has primary legislative powers in most fields of domestic policy, including tax-varying powers (on income tax) — a.k.a. **legislative devolution.**

How Scotland got devolved was more of a 'process and not an event'. It's changed over time and will continue to change, especially with growing thirst for independence.

#### Case study: the independence referendum

> [!EXAMPLE] The 2014 independence referendum
> > in late 2014, a referendum was held, with the question: 'should Scotland be an independent country?' It was majorly the SNP and other independence parties, against the Labour party and the Tory-Lib-Dem coalition government. It was a victory for the Nos, 55% - 45%, with 85% turnout. It was also the first time that the franchise was extended to 16 year olds.
> 
> Polls had indicated a victory days before the referendum. The government, pissing their pants, vowed to give the Scottish Parliament more powers and uphold the Barnett formula if Scots rejected independence.
> >[!QUESTION] What is the Barnett formula?
> > It means that Scotland is disproportionately well-funded.
> 
> This was carried out in 2016, when Scottish Parliament approved new arrangements for devolution, sometimes dubbed 'devo-max'.
> 
> > [!EXAMPLE] After the referendum
> > Cameron raised the 'English votes for English laws' issue, which (supposedly) by excluding Scottish MPs from voting on English issues, this would give England a distinctive voice in the UK.
> > 
> > It also did huge damage to the Labour party in Scotland. After the 2015 general election, they went from 41 seats to 1 in Scotland.
> 
> The referendum appeared to have settled the issue. It was a 10% victory for 'No' (so non-disputable), but also granted more powers to the Scottish Parliament.
> > Also, SNP leaders were concerned that a second referendum defeat could destroy the independence movement. However, this was abruptly cut from the agenda post-Brexit. Since 62% of Scottish voters backed Remain, Nicola Sturgeon raised the possibility of a second independence referendum as the only means of respecting the wished of Scottish voters.

## Welsh devolution
The Welsh Assembly was, in origin, an example of **administrative devolution,** having no tax-varying powers and only secondary legislative powers. However, following a referendum in 2011, the Welsh Assembly gained primary legislative powers in all 20 areas for which it is responsible.

Welsh devolution is even more of a 'process not an event.' In 1997, they were fairly ambivalent to the issue, although they did enjoy self-rule more than expected. They certainly aren't similar to Scotland in devolution.
> This is in part because of the difference between the SNP and Plaid Cymru. The latter has not seen any real change in it's power across Wales, and Labour is consistently holding half of the seats.
> > This may be because nationalism in Wales is more cultural than political.
