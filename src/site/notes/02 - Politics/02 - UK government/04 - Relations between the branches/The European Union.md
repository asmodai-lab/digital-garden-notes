>[!INFO] **The Schuman Declaration**
>“World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it…The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany. Any action taken must in the first place concern these two countries. With this aim in view, the French Government proposes that action be taken immediately on one limited but decisive point. It proposes that Franco-German production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common High Authority, within the framework of an organisation open to the participation of the other countries of Europe.”

## What makes up the EU

In 1951, the European Steel and Coal community was created on the basis of the Schuman declaration.
- the states in it were France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg
The ECSC was very successful. Subsequently, the European Economic Community was created in 1957. This promoted trade and peace between member states.

### What is the Single Market?

**Freedom of movement for:**
1. goods
2. services
3. capital
4. people

### What is the European Monetary Union?
The European and Monetary Union is an attempt to create a single currency across the EU. Britain had an opt-out from the EMU. However, Britain was hurt quite badly by preparations for closer monetary union.
> In October 1990, Britain joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism. This would attempt to stabilise EEC currencies by tying them to the German Mark. However, this turned out to be a disaster as currency speculators bet on the pound’s decline and Britain was eventually forced to leave the ERM on Black Wednesday. This episode cost around £3.4 billion.

## Why was Britain's position in the EU unique?

### Schengen agreement

The Schengen Agreement is essentially the practiced version of the freedom of people: creating an area which citizens can pass through customs without having to produce a passport.

In 2019, 22/28 members were in the Schengen Area.
> Britain argued that, as an island, it was in a unique position. It was not in the Schengen Area.

### Economic and monetary Union

As part of the **Maastricht Treaty** (1993) a single currency was introduced. 19/27 member states currently use the Euro.

Tony Blair was keen to adopt the Euro and promised a referendum on the issue. However, it was unpopular and Labour backed down.

### Area of Freedom, Justice and Security

The Area of Freedom, Justice and Security are a set of home and justice policies that all members sign up to implement. For example, members would be required to implement the same border controls and asylum policies. Britain had an opt-out for the full quota of policies but did participate in some areas.

### Charter of Fundamental Rights

The Charter of Fundamental Rights was signed in 2000. It codifies certain political, social and economic rights of citizens across the EU. It also gives EU Courts the power to strike down national laws that do not comply with the Charter. Britain had an opt-out from the Charter, meaning EU Courts could not overturn UK Statutes.

### Britain's Rebates

In addition to these opt-outs, Britain had a rebate that reduced the amount of money it contributed to the EU Budget each year. The rebate was negotiated by the government of Margaret Thatcher in 1985 and sees a net reduction of 66% in the amount Britain was expected to pay.

## What impact did EU membership have in Britain?

### Sovereignty issues

When joining the EU, Britain had to accept the sovereignty of EU law over UK law.
> This was codified in the European Communities Act 1972

>[!QUOTE] European Communities Act 1972
>_“All such rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions from time to time created or arising by or under the Treaties, and all such remedies and procedures from time to time provided for by or under the Treaties, as in accordance with the Treaties are without further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the United Kingdom shall be recognised and available in law, and be enforced, allowed and followed accordingly.”_

#### Section 2 of the ECA 1972

However, it took the Factortame Case to finally confirm this into UK law.

>[!INFO] What was the Factortame Case?
>A group of Spanish fishermen argued that laws passed by the UK parliament requiring British vessels to be majority-owned by British Citizens violated EU law. This case went to the then highest court — the Appellate Committee — who ruled against the UK government.
>>This was a landmark decision, confirming that the ECA remained constitutional/statute.

>[!TIP] Extra example
>In 1988 the British Parliament passed the Merchant Shipping Act (1988). The Act made it harder for shipping forms owned outside the UK to register vessels in Britain and therefore quality to catch fish under the British quota. A number of Spanish firms, trading under the name Factortame Ltd, said that the UK law breached EU law and was discriminatory based on nationality and therefore contrary to freedom of movement.
>
>The case was taken to court and ended up in the Appellate Committee. The Committee had to consider whether it could disapply domestic law (the Merchant Shipping Act) when it conflicted with EU law. There were a number of ‘Factortame Cases’. 
>
>The key finding of the court, however, was that EU law did take precedence UK law. This was because of the European Communities Act (1972) which said that:
>>[!QUOTE]
>>_“All such rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions from time to time created or arising by or under the Treaties, and all such remedies and procedures from time to time provided for by or under the Treaties, as in accordance with the Treaties are without further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the United Kingdom shall be recognised and available in law, and be enforced, allowed and followed accordingly”_
>
> The European Union Withdrawal Act (2018) repealed the European Communities Act, and therefore, the case law surrounding the Factortame Case.

### Other policy issues

Between 1990 and 2010, there were 50,000 laws passed in the UK because of directives or regulations from the EU. Significant policies had a major impact — such as:

#### The Commons Fisheries policy

This regulated fishing in the EU. It set quotas on numbers and types of fish that fishermen in EU member states are allowed to catch, and aims to encourage long-term viability of the fishing industry.

There were four key aims:
1. regulate quality of fish products and packaging
2. regulate the market to discourage spikes in pricing
3. regulate minimum prices to support fisherman
4. regulate trade of fish between EU and non-EU states.

##### Pros and Cons for Britain

| Pros                                                                                                                                                                        | Cons                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Since the CFP, fish stocks have replenished to sustainable levels. Popular fish like cod may well have been fished to extinction without quotas.                            | It arguably hurt Britain disproportionately as an island nation. Of 6 million tonnes of fish caught in the EU, 700,000 were caught in the UK.                                                                                                                               |
| There are a number of fish not covered under the CFP. These include crab, shellfish and lobsters, which were managed independently in Britain.                              | Although UK waters are extensive, lots of fish central to the UK economy only passed through them and could not be consistently fished. An example of this is mackerel.                                                                                                     |
| The quota system was managed independently, taking the risk of a repeat of the ‘Cod Wars’ of the 1960s out of reckoning.                                                    | Certain fish, like cod, are populous in the North Sea. However, they prefer spawning along the border between UK and Norwegian waters. It is impossible therefore to accurately give a quota to the UK on this fish stock that is very important to the UK fishing economy. |
| The UK fishing industry makes up less than 0.5% of GDP. The CFP was arguably a price worth paying for the other benefits Britain gained, for example in financial services. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
