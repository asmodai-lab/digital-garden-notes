### History of the supreme Court
#### The law lords
Until <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">2009,</span> the highest court was the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.

The <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">fundamental problem with this was separation of powers</span>. The law lords also had say over the laws which they would later have to enforce.
- they<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> did rarely vote or speak in the Lords</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">but</span> this was only a <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">convention.</span>

>[!EXAMPLE] The political role of the Law Lords
> Although they were members of the House of Lords, by convention they didn't interact, in order to ensure their independence. However, this was broken on a number of occasions;
> 1. 1996 --> Lord Hoffman proposed an amendment to the Bill of Rights in order to allow Neil Hamilton (Tory MP accused of Cash for Questions) to sue the Guardian for defamation
> 2. 1999 --> Hoffman sat on a case regarding whether former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet could be extradited, despite being a director of Amnesty who were involved in the case
> 3. Hoffman and Scott had to be rescued from a case because they had voted against the Hunting Act 2004.
> > [!EXAMPLE] Statistics
> > Researchers found that, between 1880 and 2015, Law Lords often spoke in debates — at some point being a quarter.

#### The Constitutional Reform Act 2005

- this was part of New Labour's constitutional reforms. It aimed to:
1. **establish a supreme court to address separation of powers**
2. **change the role of Lord Chancellor** (who was, beforehand, <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">speaker of the Lords</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">head of the Judiciary</span>, and a<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> Cabinet Minister</span>. The act <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">removed</span> the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Lord Chancellor</span> as the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">speaker</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">head of judiciary</span>, although <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">by convention </span>the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> Lord Chancellor</span> is <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">still the head of the judiciary</span>.)
>[!WARNING] Be careful!
> although this suggests that the Lord Chancellor still has a lot of power over appointments, in reality he is expected to accept the recommendation of the Selection Commission.
3. **creation of the judicial appointments commission** — the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Lord Chancellor lost the ability</span> to<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> make judicial appointments</span> and this was given to an<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> independent commission.</span>

### The Supreme Court now
#### How is it organised?
- made up of<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> 12 justices</span>, with one head and one deputy. Contains justices from all countries in Great Britain guaranteed.
	- 11 of the 12 Law Lords joined the Supreme Court
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Not all members sit on cases</span>. The more important a case, the more justices sit (like the Miller cases.)

#### What is it's role?
1. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">final court of appeal</span> in both civil & criminal cases in all British countries except Scotland.
2. It hears<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> issues of public importance</span>
3. it concentrates on cases of the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> greatest public and constitutional importance</span>
4. it upholds the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> common law</span>
5. it adjudicates on <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">devolution matters</span>

>[!EXAMPLE] Supreme Court adjudicating on devolution
>The first case on devolution in the court was Martin and Miller v. Lord Advocate 2010. 
>> this was because the Scottish Parliament tried to legislate on reserved powers, within the purview of Westminster.
>> The issue surrounded driving offences, which are legislated on by Westminster. However, Scotland believed that if these offences were 'criminal', Scotland could legislate on it as it controls it's criminal law.
>> > the supreme court upheld Scotland's right to do this.
>
> Another case occurred after the Scottish Parliament passed the draft Scottish Independence Referendum Bill. This called for a second referendum to be held in 2023 on the same terms as in 2014. This was sent to the court over whether this was within the Scottish Parliament's power. 
> >The court ruled that it wasn't, denting the SNP's plans

##### Membership of the Supreme Court
There have been 33 justices total since it's creation.
- 28 have been male, 5 female
- 26 were privately educated, 6 were state educated
- 29 attended Oxbridge, 4 did not

There are arguments for and against proportional representation (also known as descriptive representation) within the judiciary.


| It matters                                                                              | It doesn't matter                                                                      |

| Makes it more legitimate and trustworthy                                                | Undermines the quality of justices if they aren't qualified                            |
| Makes better decisions with a wider range of perspectives                               | Judges chosen on background may not be able to make impartial decisions                |
| Diverse justices are more likely to understand challenges faced by minorities in the UK | Undermines the aim of increasing diversity — should just be equal opportunity, not DEI |

##### Differences between the Law Lords and the Supreme Court
**Similarities**
- the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> manner in which the court hears cases</span> is very similar, most coming from the Court of Appeal
- the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> composition</span> is mostly similar
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Early decisions were similar in opinion</span> to the Law Lords
- cases are <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">usually heard by 5 justices </span>
-<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> level of power</span> is the same
-<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> tension</span> between Judges and Politicians existed before the reform
**Differences**
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">transparency.</span> The Court uses social media, publishes press summaries of cases, and is streamed online when possible.
	- <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">appointments </span>also 
- clearer <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">separation of powers</span>
	- physical separation by building
- more <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">visible </span>(cameras)
- Rulings are passed down in a clearer way with press summaries
	- <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">greater</span><span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> scrutiny</span> by the public

Some argue that there hasn't been any fundamental change from the Law Lords. For example, the court's rulings have been mainly regarding the concept of the government acting *Ultra Vires* (beyond the law) and making  'declarations of incompatibility' under the HRA.

### Relationship between the Judiciary and Parliament

In the US, the Supreme Court can check a law as 'unconstitutional', because the Constitution is sovereign.
- in the UK,<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> Parliament is sovereign.</span> You can imagine the difference in powers, now

1. in the UK, judges **do**<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> have to account the wishes of Parliament</span>
	1. their job is, partly, to<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> 'fill the gaps'</span> in State Law, because obviously Statute Law isn't going to be 100% perfect and account for all situations.
2.<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> Parliament can say 'nu uh' </span>to any ruling by just making a new law

>[!EXAMPLE] Examples
> **Rwanda Plan 2023**: In 2023, the court rules that the Govt. plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawful. This was because Rwanda was not deemed a safe third country.
> > Parliament consequently passed the Safety of Rwanda Act that changed this.
> 
> **Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010**: HM Treasury v. Mohammed Jabar Ahmed ruled that the Govt. acted unlawfully by freezing the assets of suspected terrorists. 
> > The govt. didn't like this, so they convinced Parliament to pass the aforementioned Act.

#### Judicial review

Judicial review is when the court reviews the actions of the govt. or a public body to consider whether they have acted beyond the law — also known as *Ultra Vires*.

This can be split further:
1. **illegality**: an action not taken in accordance with the law that regulates it *or* goes beyond the powers delegated to that body
2. **irrationality**: an action was not taken reasonably
3. **irregularity**: a failure to consult or act in accordance with 'natural justice' — or with the underpinning procedural rule of carrying out the law.

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Only ~5% of judicial review cases reach the supreme court.</span> Most are withdrawn, refused, or settled outside of court.

>[!EXAMPLE] Conservative election manifesto
> in their 2019 election manifesto, the Tories pledged to *'ensure judicial review is available to protect the rights of the individuals against an overbearing state, whilst ensuring that it is not abused to conduct politics by other means or create needless delays.'*
> This was put into action through the **Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022**. This act:
> - protected certain decisions from judicial review
> 	- particularly regarding immigration and human rights
> - it introduced suspended quashing orders
> 	- this means that a judge can set a time limit for the Government tor rectify it's error, rather than immediately quashing it.
> Critics said was an attempt to limit the power of the judiciary, especially after **Miller v. Prime Minister** — a decision which the govt. did not approve of. 
> > However, the Tory govt. argued that there were simply too many judicial review cases, and the courts couldn't cope.

However, in 2007, the Treasury said they had reasonable grounds for suspecting terrorist links. All three denied this.

These included:<br>>David Chaytor (Labour) – Guilty of false accounting of £18,350. Sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.<br>>> and others<br>These MPs argued that their actions were protected by parliamentary privilege as the expenses were necessary for them to fulfil their role as MPs. They then argued that the Crown (criminal) Court had no jurisdiction and the conviction should be overturned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Whether the otherwise illegal actions taken were not the jurisdiction of the criminal courts because they were privileged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Dismissed the arguments of the MPs.

The journalist applied under the FOI Act for the letters to be disclosed, because it was in the public interest. The govt. refused, arguing that they were written expecting confidentiality, and disclosing them would damage Charles' ability to be King in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Whether communications between a member of the Royal Family (notably the next in line) and govt. ministers were disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act, or if it was an exception due to Sections 37, 40, and 41, which:<br>>limited disclosure of comms with the monarch or heir<br>>any info deemed personal data within the Data Protection Act<br>>info provided in confidence would be a breach of confidence if disclosed. | Upper Tribunal ruled that many of the letters — some of which were political in nature — should be disclosed.

| **Steinfield and Keiden v Home Secretary (2018)**                      | in 2004, the Civil Partnerships Act was passed, granting same-sex couples the right to seek a civil partnership. There were some differences though:<br>1. adultery was grounds for divorce but not dissolution of a civil partnership.<br>Many straight couples argued that this was discriminatory under the ECHR and the HRA. The govt. argued that the CPA was designed to give gay couples rights that they did not have otherwise, and so was proportionate means to achieve a legitimate aim. However, after the Same-Sex Marriage Act (2013) passed, this was a weak argument. A couple decided to launch a judicial review challenge.                                                                                   | Whether precluding straight couples from entering into civil partnerships was discriminatory & non-compatible with human rights laws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Rejected the arguments of the couple. 'The difference in treatment complained of does not infringe a personal interest close to the core of the right to family life, still less the right to private life protected (by the ECHR.)'                                                                           | The Supreme Court ruled that the procedures were ultra vires. They found that although precluding heterosexual couples from a civil partnership had originally been legitimate and proportionate, this position was no longer possible to maintain now that same-sex couples had equal marriage rights. The Court decided that the elements of the CPA that precluded it as an option for same-sex couples were incompatible with Article 8 of the ECHR |
| **Lee v. Ashers Baking Company Ltd and others (2018)**                 | in 2014, a volunteer for an LGBT organisation in Belfast entered a shop and ordered a custom made cake, in order to mark anti-homophobia week. He had previously bought cakes from that shop without issue. He asked for the cake to have gay stuff on it, and the order was taken and paid for. Afterwards, the owner phoned the activist to tell him they couldn't do it because they were Christians. The activist took them to court claiming discrimination over sexual orientation and political opinion. The bakery argued that they could refuse because they didn't do it on the basis of him being gay, but because they didn't support the political message, and were acting within freedom of political expression. | Whether the activist has been discriminated against based on sexual orientation, and secondly, whether a business can cite religious or political beliefs in refusing service to a customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | A court ruled in Lee's (the activist) favour, but was appealed higher, making the N. Irish govt. party to the case. The Attorney-General requested the case go to the Supreme Court because of conflict between the ECHR and N. Irish law. The Court of Appeal rejected this, and agreed with the lower court. | The Supreme Court ruled in favour of the bakery, distinguishing the message ('support gay rights') from being homosexual. They ruled that the bakers could not be obliged to take an action that they profoundly disagreed with due to their own political beliefs.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Miller v. Prime Minister (2019)**                                    | In 2019, Parliament was prorogued on the advice of the PM, Johnson. The govt. claimed that it was necessary as parliament had sat for 341 days, longer than most cases. However, the length of the proposed prorogation was 3 weeks, when most were 1 week. The govt. was suspected of doing this in order to stop MPs from debating on Brexit to put pressure on parliament to accept a deal before the deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | First, whether the PM prorogued parliament in order to stifle parliamentary scrutiny, (which would be Ultra Vires), and second, whether — as a political decision — it was subject to judicial review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Ruled that the case wasn't under judicial review, so it wasn't within their power to make a judgement. Although, a Scottish Court found it unlawful.                                                                                                                                                           | The case heard was an amalgamation of appeals for two separate cases: the Scottish and English ones. The court ruled that Johnson's prorogation was unlawful. They stressed that the govt.'s motives weren't a central issue, it was that the prorogation stifled parliamentary debate, which was undemocratic, and stopped parliament carrying out it's functions without reasonable justification.                                                    |

Judicial Independence is the notion that judges should be a separate entity from the other branches of government. Judicial Independence is necessary to truly uphold the Rule of Law. The opposite of Judicial Independence is Judicial Activism. This is the term given when the judiciary have a more active role in the political system. Increasingly, despite the changes made in the <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Constitutional Reform Act (2005)</span>, it may actually be becoming harder for judges to maintain political independence.

### How is independence maintained?

1. **Security of Tenure**: they can only be removed by a vote in both Houses of Parliament
2. **Guaranteed salaries**: judge pay isn't set by politicians — so they don't have to impress them to get a pay rise.
3. **Contempt of Court**: it is a criminal offence for politicians to speak about a criminal case during the proceedings, in order to stop cases being politicised
4. **The Judicial Appointments Commission**: avoids previous Cronyism
5. **Reputation**: Judges rely on their reputation for impartiality for career advancements. Most judges are unwilling to become politicised.

### Why has there been tension between the judiciary and govt?

1. **Sentencing**: politicians often think that judges are too lenient. The govt. have the right to seek review of sentences through the 'unduly lenient' scheme. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">This happened in the case of Wayne Couzens, murderer of Sarah Everard.</span> 
2. **Parole**: politicians don't like when judges rule that prominent prisoners should be given parole. In the past, the Home Secretary could ensure a prisoner be imprisoned for life. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Recently, Dominic Raab criticised the Parole Board for agreeing to release Tracy Conolly, murderer of Baby P (related of the Letby case)</span> 
3. **Judicial review**: obviously, Conservatives have attempted to limit judicial review from the start of Johnson's premiership.
4. **Rights**: there is tension over rights. The govt. wants to emphasis public protection over individual rights, but the courts often consider differently. This can be seen in <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"><span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">A. v. Home Secretary</span></span> 

><span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> In March 2025 a row occurred after the Sentencing Council published new guidelines that said that a criminal’s ethnic background should be taken into account when setting a sentence. The government are concerned that this creates a “two-tier” legal system, with someone being treated differently because of their background. As a result, the government is considering legislation to force the Sentencing Council to change their guidelines.</span> 

>[!TIP] Politicians on respecting the independence of the judiciary
> Traditionally, it was expected that senior politicians would be careful in what they publically said about the judiciary, in order to respect it's independence. However, in recent years this convention has been less respected:
> > In 2025, during the Tory party conference, Robert Jenrick faced criticism for comments he made in his conference speech on 'activist' judges. Jenrick, the Shadow Justice Secretary, said that under the Tories, govt. ministers would have a greater involvement in the appointment of judges to stop '[judges] who blur the line between adjudication and activism.'
> 
> > Also in 2025, Kier Starmer publicly criticised a court decision to grant a Palestinian family the right to remain in the UK. The comment was made in PMQs. The Chief Justice of England and Wales said she was deeply concerned that he remarked this publically.

| They allow controversial issues to be considered beyond the political arena. The evidence-based approach and independence of those leading them adds significantly to the legitimacy of their findings. | Many inquiries take an extremely long time to publish. Notably, the Chilcott Inquiry published its findings much later than planned. This led to much frustration by the public.                |
| People are much more likely to trust an independent inquiry that has been carried out than an inquiry carried out by Parliament.                                                                        | Inquiries are often hugely expensive. For example, the Bloody Sunday Inquiry cost £210.6 million pounds. The main reason for this cost is the legal expertise that is needed to carry them out. |
| Statutory Inquiries can take evidence under oath and can subpoena witnesses. This allows for the public to trust that those given evidence is doing so truthfully.                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |


### Examples of Judge-Led Inquiries

 **Saville Inquiry (1998-2010):** During the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland up to 21,000 British troops were deployed in a peacekeeping operation. On the 30th January 1972 a march was held in Londonderry in protest of republicans who had been held without trial by the British government. The 1st Battalion of the parachute regiment were deployed to the area. On arrival the paratroopers were ordered to arrest rioters. The situation escalated quickly and a number of shots were fired by the British Army. In total, 26 people were shot and 14 people were killed.

 The Saville Report was published on the 15th June 2010. The report was clear that British Soldiers were to blame for the killings. Saville found that British soldiers on that day had “lost control” and that they should never have been in the Bogside area in the first place. The report also found that British soldiers had colluded to cover the truth in the aftermath of the incident. On the day that report was published David Cameron, just two months into his tenure as Prime Minister, addressed the House of Commons and apologised on behalf of the British Government.

 **Hutton Inquiry (2003)**: The Hutton inquiry was a 2003 investigation into the 2003 death of David Kelly, a UN weapons inspector in Iraq. The investigation was led by Lord Hutton, a judge and the head of the Court of Appeal. David Kelly had been the source of suggestions by BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan that the Iraq Dossier had been ‘sexed up’ by Tony Blair’s government in order to win support for war in Iraq. The inquiry delved deep into the heart of the Tony Blair government and particularly, the relationship between Tony Blair’s government and the Press.

 **Leveson Inquiry (2011-2012)**: In reaction to the Phone Hacking Scandal, Lord Leveson led an independent inquiry into the issue. This went to the heart of David Cameron’s government, because the editor of the News of the World during the scandal, Andrew Coulson, had gone on to become David Cameron’s Director of Communications. Most embarrassing for the government, was the seemingly intimate relationships between all recent governments and the media mogul, Robert Murdoch.
