| Affirmative action programmes make a considerable difference to education and income for racial minorities with longer-term generational impacts.                                                                           | Affirmative action | There is still a major socio-economic gap between racial groups, especially on home ownership (~35% disparity between white and black people) <br> and passing wealth to the next generation.<br>Many affirmative action programmes have been cancelled because of unpopularity — even before Trump's war on DEI. Once the programs ended, rates lowered significantly.<br>*Students for Fair Admissions v Harvard 2023* ended affirmative action in Uni admissions processes. | <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">While affirmative action programmes were effective, upon their removal rates of various things lowered again. On top of this, the disenfranchisement of minorities in America is systemic and generational — a problem which affirmative action alone could not fix.</span>                                                                            |
| There has been huge progress in legal protections for racial minorities voting — e.g. Voting Rights Act 1964. <br>*Cooper v. Harris* 2017 ruled that N. Carolina's redistricting was illegal because it was racially based. | Voting rights      | Main legal protections have been significantly weakened with the [[02 - Politics/Race rights success#The Shelby ruling\|Shelby ruling]], which interest groups are powerless to stop.<br>On top of this, many states attempt to systematically restrict or weaken the power of minority voting.<br>*Recently, Texas tried to gerrymander and was blocked by federal courts — which was then blocked by the Supreme Court.*                                                                   | <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">While voting rights are protected in theory, they aren't in practice. Free and open gerrymandering from both sides — of which the Supreme Court protects (in the Texas case/ for Republicans), disenfranchisement of African Americans with felony convictions — i.e. not able to vote, etc.</span>                                                    |
| There has been a major increase in minority representation in all branches of govt — In the HoR, Black representation is ~ proportional to the population.                                                                  | Representation     | Minority groups are still severely underrepresented in the senate, on top of minority people almost never being in significant positions of power. While 40% of Biden's cabinet were racial minorities, it was only 20% for Trump.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">The increase of minority groups in government across the board, in all levels of power, has been a major success. Many groups are either represented almost at the scale of their population or not far off. Just because of the fact that the President is (almost) always white, does not take away from representation at every other level.</span> |
### Conclusion

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Overall, racial rights have not been successfully protected to a significant extent. In the face of the continued erosions of the Voting Rights Act, on top of blatant and protected gerrymandering, on top of the discontinuation of affirmative action programmes — which has only deepened the systemic disenfranchisement of racial minorities in the USA — the argument of increased minority representation in government cannot be successful, since increased representation clearly hasn't lessened the systemic disenfranchisement and backsliding of legal protections for racial minorities in the USA.</span>

## The Shelby ruling

>[!INFO] Shelby v. Holder 2013
> Shelby v. Holder was a Supreme Court case which undermined provisions of the Voting Rights Act. It gave states much greater individual control over voting — including rules on voter registration.
> >[!EXAMPLE] Example — Texas 2021
> >Texas used the Shelby ruling to impose rules restricting the hours of voting, and also banning extending voting hours if there were queues of people still waiting to vote.
> >>This is a problem because there are less voting stations in black areas, which is on purpose.
