> There is no solid spectrum for ideologies- there are no opposites or true 'left' and 'right'. Attempting to view this as black and white is nonsense, even attempting to do it in colour is nonsense. You need ten fucking dimensions for this. Also, they aren't all separate, they all contain shared ideas. 


There are two types of ideology:

**Explanatory**: explaining **how** the world works

**Normative**: morally what 'should' happen- how society *should* be
> The only ideology that doesn't have a normative element is conservatism.

# Liberalism- the basic ideology is 'freedom'

## Classical liberals is what we call 'right wing liberals'.
- they believe that the state is the biggest threat to freedom, so they want smaller state

## Modern liberals
- the state gives rights, so it isn't a threat
- modern liberals think that since having no money means you can't do much, so it means you have less freedom
- so the idea is that the state can do things to give the poor more opportunities


# Socialism

They want equality of power- everyone has an equal say in what happens with a group. The focus is now on culture, not on money. 

It was traditionally based on wealth, but now it's more on culture. (?)

# Conservatives

They value stability- and to some extent protect 'sacred things.' (Like how you can't make jokes about the Holocaust.) For some, this 'sacred' idea is turned up quite far.
- it's a knee-jerk response for most
Conservativism changes a LOT based on the time and space that it is in.
