## John Locke (1632-1704)
Locke was an early English liberal philosopher whose views developed against the backdrop of the English revolution and are often seen as the ideas behind/spurring on the 'Glorious Revolution' of 1688 — which ended absolutist monarchy rule in the UK.

### Rights
Locke placed huge emphasis on the idea of natural rights.
> This is an expression of the idea that there are certain moral rights that apply to all people. 

Today, we call these human rights. Locke defined these ass the right to life, liberty, and property. This means that while all have the right to these, others also have a duty not to deprive people of these.

He argued that one of the principle justifications of government was the protection of these rights and believed that the purpose of law was to preserve and enlarge freedom.

> [!quote] "where there is no law, there is no freedom."

Locke's attitudes towards property rights are his most important contributions to political thought. He believed that God gave the earth to all, but that the labour of our own body and the work of our hands can convert property from common -> private ownership. 
- so, when someone picks acorns and berries, they belong to the person who picked them up

### Social contract
Locke argued that society without a state, known as a 'state of nature' could be one of '*peace, goodwill, mutual assistance and preservation.*' However, he also recognised that this has weaknesses, especially if natural laws were violated.

Hence, Locke suggested that people would agree to transfer these rights to a government, which makes the justice system a legitimate system of government.

Legitimate government is established by the consent of the governed.

### Limited and legitimate governments
Locke argued that nobody can become subject to any law, except by their consent, arguing that the government needed to be limited to protecting property, keeping the peace, and protecting citizens from foreign attack to ensure freedom.

An illegitimate government fails to protect the rights of it's subjects, and in the worst cases, will violate the rights of it's subjects. Locke is very clear that illegitimate government should be overthrown by the people.

>[!quote] "revolt is the right of the people."


### Toleration
In Locke's *Letter Concerning Toleration*, he argued that the government shouldn't use force to convince people that a certain view is true — and this applies to all other groups in society. 

True faith cannot be forced, and one has no more reason to think that they are right than anyone else. Hence, for Locke: '*the care, therefore, of every man's soul belongs unto himself, and it is to be left unto himself,*' i.e. the government has no business interfering with people's views.

## Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-97)
Mary Wollstonecraft was a pioneer in feminist thinking. Her book, *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman*, stressed the equal rights of women — especially in education — based on the notion of 'personhood.'

### Reason
Wollstonecraft's work drew on a belief in reason. Throughout her work, she maintained the view that women were deserving of the same fundamental rights, opportunities, and education as men.

One of her main objectives was that women should be viewed as human first and foremost, rather than as a separate, different species to men.

> [!quote] "I shall first consider women in the grand light of human creatures, who, in common with men, are placed on this earth to unfold their faculties."

She argued that both men and women should be treated equally, based on the view that men and women are both rational human beings. 

### Independence
Wollstonecraft insisted that girls and young women should be made to acquire 'inner resources', so as to make them as psychologically independent as possible. 

> [!quote] ‘I wish to show that elegance is inferior to virtue, that the first object of laudable ambition is to obtain a character as a human being, regardless of the distinction of sex.'

She wanted to enable women to become rational and independent beings whose sense of worth came not from their appearance, but from their inner perception of self-command and knowledge. Women were ill-prepared for their duties as social beings and imprisoned in a web of false expectations that would inevitably make them miserable.

> [!quote] ‘Taught from infancy that beauty is woman’s sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison.'

### Education
Her final idea was that women were seen as secondary in nature to men in society. There are '*rendered weak and wretched*', and this was the result of the discriminatory education system. Women are treated as subordinate beings, that are '*so much degraded*' that they are not even seen as human beings, and are wholly unaware of their inferior conditions. '*I do not wish them [women] to have power over men; but over themselves.*'

Their total disadvantage and narrowness of mind was entirely down to societies false systems of education. As women were unable to gain a fair education, there were therefore incapable of defending their basic rights.

## John Stuart Mill (1806-73)
Mill's work straddles between classical and modern liberalism. His major writings include *On Liberty*, *Utilitarianism*, and *Considerations on Representative Government*.

### Harm Principle
Mill believed that individuals must be free to pursue their own notion of a good life. 

He defended the role of government according to the harm principle, and was very clear that restricting individuals for their own good was not sufficient reason, even if it is believed that the individual would be happier.

> [!quote] ‘These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise.’

For Mill, the harm principle is the sole legitimate basis for restricting individual liberties.

For Mill there were different threats to liberty. The old threat was from monarchy or aristocracy, but these were not the only ones: democracies contained their own threats to liberty. 

In *Considerations on Representative Government*, Mill argued that a form of representative democracy is the best for of government for societies with:
1. sufficient resources
2. security
3. a culture of self-reliance

> [!quote] 'It is important that every one of the governed should have a voice in the government.'

-> because it satisfied two key criteria the best:
1. the government promotes the common good, i.e. promoting the moral, intellectual, and active traits of it's citizens
2. the government is good when it makes effective use of institutions and the resources of it's citizens to promote the common good

However, he expressed concern over the notion of universal suffrage, arguing that those with more knowledge should have more votes than those who were ignorant and uneducated.
> *Mill's support for non-universal suffrage sounds deeply illiberal to modern liberals.*

### Individuality
Mill believed that individuality was the foundation of a healthy society, and was concerned about 'tyranny of the majority.'
- he feared that this could lead to unthinking conformity and political tyranny, which would limit individual freedom.
The unthinking following of customs should be discouraged in society, as the key to a vibrant, civil society was tolerance and pluralism.

> [!quote] 'The despotism of custom is everywhere the standing hindrance to human advancement.'

Without freedom of thought and expression, progress, knowledge, and innovation would be restricted. Individuals need to be able to challenge their ideas against others in order to assess their validity.

Mill distinguished between higher and lower pleasures. Lower pleasures are physical pleasures — food, drink, sex, shelter, etc. Higher pleasures are intellectual, cultural, philosophical and spiritual: like art, music, poetry, and socialising.

Mill thought that higher pleasures were far superior to lower ones, as once humans connected with their higher pleasures, they would never be happy without them. Individuals who employ higher faculties are often less content, because they have a deeper sense of the limitations of the world.

> [!quote] 'it is better to be a human dissatisfied than a pig satisfied.'

## John Rawls (1921-2002)
A US political philosopher who used a form of social contract theory to reconcile liberal individualism with the principles of redistribution and social justice. In his major work, *A Theory of Justice* (1970), he developed the notion of 'justice as fairness'.

### Justice as fairness
This is Rawls' theory of justice for a liberal society; it recommends equal basic rights, equality of opportunity and promoting the interests of the least advantaged members of society. Justice meant society should be accessible to all. A society with fundamental inequality of opportunity at its heart could not be a just one. 

Rawls identified two guiding principles:
1. Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive liberty compatible with a similar liberty for all.
2. Social and economic equalities are to be organized so they are both:
	1. to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged
	2. allow all positions and offices to be open to all under conditions of equality of opportunity.

The first principle is commitment to liberty. The second is aiming towards distributive justice, i.e. that inequalities of wealth to incentivize people are acceptable as long as they raise the prosperity of the least well-off. 

However, Rawls was very clear that the first principle takes priority over the second; liberty for all is more important than the prosperity of society, i.e. if reducing liberty would result in greater economic growth and prosperity: the economic advantages are not worth the loss of liberty.

For Rawls, the way to do this was via the social institutions at the heart of society: education, healthcare, and welfare. Rawls believed that a capitalist economy with strong social institutions would result in a fair and just society. Capitalism on its own was not sufficient to ensure fairness.

### The original position, veil of ignorance and the difference principle
Rawls suggested a way of agreeing how society should organize itself where the citizens are free and equal, and society fair. 

The **'original position'** is Rawls' hypothetical scenario where people are set the task of reaching an agreement about how to create a just society. These decisions are made behind a **'veil of ignorance'** where knowledge of one's gender, race, age, intelligence, wealth, skills, education, and religion are unknown. Rawls argued that this was the best way to ensure that no one considered their own vested interest.

He suggested that all rational individuals in these circumstances would advocate an unequal society, but one where the differences between individuals was not too great. This position is expressed in the 'difference principle', according to which, in a system of ignorance about one's status, one would strive to improve the position of the worst off, because he might find himself in that position.

## Betty Friedan
Betty Friedan is seen as the founder of the women's liberation movement. It's a tad nonsensical to have her as a key thinker in liberalism, but she adds much to the debate about equality of opportunity, as well as reforming society legally and gradually.

Friedan believes that women are insufficiently free in society. They argue that decisions are made *for* women, but which don't reflect their capabilities and needs. This means that women are unable to flourish in society. Freedom is a means to personal autonomy— i.e. the ability to live the life of your choosing, which includes political autonomy.

### Problem with no name
Friedan made her most famous discovery while asking alumni during a college reunion to complete a survey on their experiences of the workplace after graduating. Their responses were so similar that Friedan realised that she was onto something: described as the 'problem with no name'.

> [!quote] The Feminine Mystique, 1963
> 'The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years... a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that women suffered... each suburban (house)wife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries... she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question — "Is this all?"'

This is linked to the notion of positive freedom, developmental individualism and equality of opportunity. Women were unable to thrive, grow or develop in society as their choices had been predetermined. Society had already decided that a life of domesticity (looking after a home, a husband and children) made women happy. It was so pervasive in society that women who felt stifled and unfulfilled wondered what was wrong with them. Why were they unhappy? They felt guilty for not feeling more fulfilled.

Friedan argued that women were as capable as men of any type of work or any career path, which, at the time, ran contrary to the wide perceptions in the media and wider society. Friedan revealed a pervasive paternalistic culture which sought to keep women in a lower position in society with the argument that this was their ‘natural’ role, where men knew what was best for women rather than the equal moral worth agenda espoused by so many liberals at the time. This was the same paternalism that liberalism had been seeking to eradicate in society. Friedan was simply asking
that women were treated like humans too, as J.S. Mill had begun to do a century before. She was seeking to challenge attitudes that limited the freedom and individualism of half the population of the world.
