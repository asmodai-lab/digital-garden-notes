## Summary
- Liberals believe in the power and capacity of individuals to transform their own lives
- it places the individual at the centre of decision making
- the individual has higher claims than the group
- it is often understood in the sense of personal autonomy

## What is it?
As feudal societies moved towards capitalism, people were encouraged to think for themselves. As a result, society was increasingly<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> understood from</span> the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">viewpoint of the individual.</span>

The belief in the **primacy of the individual** is the characteristic theme of liberalism. It's the belief in the supreme importance of the individual over any collective body, and suggests that the individual is central to any political theory.
- individuals are<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> private, separate, and unique entities</span> who have an identity distinct to others which must be respected. 
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Society is established</span> by individuals for the<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> fulfilment of their own ends</span>, not the other way round.

Individualism also implies that<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> society should be constructed to benefit the individual</span> — giving priority to individual rights/needs/interests.

This is best summed up by J.S. Mill:
> [!quote] 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.'

This is similar to Kant's idea of respecting people as ends in themselves, not a means to an end. 

### Egoistic and individualistic individualism
~~ there's nothing here yet~~

### Scholars
Mary Wollstonecraft argued that tolerance out to be extended to women, in order to allow them to play a fuller role in society — particularly on having the right to vote.

Betty Friedan continued this campaign, arguing for full equality for women beyond the right to vote.

## Differences between branches
### Classical liberal views
**Strong emphasis** on individualism: the individual is<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> rational, self-reliant, and capable of making decisions in their own best interests.<br></span>
**Individuals existed prior to the state**, and society was formed through **voluntary interactions rather than collective purpose.**
- therefore, the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">role of the state</span> should be <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">limited</span> to protecting natural rights
	- such as John Locke's **life, liberty & property.**
- Any <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">expansion of state power</span> is a<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> threat </span>to individual freedom.

**Economic individualism** is central, with free markets allowing individuals to compete, innovate, and pursue success. Classical liberals **link outcomes closely with personal effort and responsibility.**

<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Critics argue that this approach underestimates the impact of social and economic inequality.</span>

### Modern liberal views

Also values it, but recognises that **individuals are shaped by social and economic circumstances**. While individuals are autonomous and deserving of rights, they argue that <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">genuine freedom requires</span> the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">capacity</span> to <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">act on choices.</span>
>[!tip] This is also known as positive freedom.

In which the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">state plays an active role</span> in **enabling** individuals to **reach their potential**. Government intervention through:
- welfare
- education
- healthcare
- anti-discrimination
is therefore justified.

Individualism is **compatible with collective action**, as reducing inequality helps <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">ensure fair opportunities</span> for all.

<span style="color:rgb(240, 40, 40)">Critics argue that this weakens personal responsibility, but modern liberals maintain that supporting individuals strengthens autonomy and meaningful freedom, rather than undermining it.</span>
