## Origins of modern Liberalism
> sometimes called '20th century liberalism'.

Like classical liberalism, the increased spread of industrialisation was the root cause of modern liberal ideas.
- the spread of social inequality because of industrialisation (i.e. the growing working class who lived in horrible conditions, in poverty, uneducated, with spreading disease) became impossible to ignore.
	- you see so many people living in shit conditions, no matter what class you are. There is no escape from seeing the shit.

There was a problem that many had with classical liberalism.

### The problems
The industrial revolution and unrestrained pursual of self-interest did NOT lead to a more socially just society!
> this didn't prove classical liberals wrong, per se, but the longer economically individualistic ideas led to rich getting richer and poor getting poorer, the more people questioned how to tweak those ideas.
> > Specifically, they focussed on how the state should intervene in people's lives in order to enable rights and freedoms

#### What do liberals think about this?
