## Origins of modern Liberalism
> sometimes called '20th century liberalism'.

Like classical liberalism, the increased spread of industrialisation was the root cause of modern liberal ideas.
- the spread of social inequality because of industrialisation (i.e. the growing working class who lived in horrible conditions, in poverty, uneducated, with spreading disease) became impossible to ignore.
	- you see so many people living in shit conditions, no matter what class you are. There is no escape from seeing the shit.

There was a problem that many had with classical liberalism.

### The problems
The industrial revolution and unrestrained pursual of self-interest did NOT lead to a more socially just society!
> this didn't prove classical liberals wrong, per se, but the longer economically individualistic ideas led to rich getting richer and poor getting poorer, the more people questioned how to tweak those ideas.
> > Specifically, they focussed on how the state should intervene in people's lives in order to enable rights and freedoms

#### What do liberals think about this?

## Ideas
### Developmental individualism
Individuals are rational and capable of making their own choices (as is the same in classical liberalism), however, it differs in that all individuals have the *potential* to do so, and the state's role is to encourage that.
### Positive freedom
The opposite of negative freedom — i.e. instead of not intervening in society so as to make everyone as free as possible, the state does intervene in order to ensure fairness: so that everyone can be as free as possible.

(It's called *positive* freedom because they are *adding* to society in order to ensure freedom, the opposite of *negative* freedom, which ensures freedom by *staying out of society.*)
### Enabling state
The state acts in society to ensure positive freedom, because of developmental individualism.
> i.e. the state intervenes in society to ensure that everything is fair *so that* everyone is free to do as they choose, and they do this *because* everyone has the potential to flourish via their own choices, because *everyone is rational, or has the potential to be rational and self-governing, given some encouragement by the government.*

### Social liberalism
Balancing individual freedom with social justice.

### Keynesian economics
One of the things that the state does to ensure freedom— i.e. intervening in the economy: so, a mixed economy.

> [!question] What is Keynesian economics, specifically, though?
> It's using government funds to intervene in the economy.
