| Social Democratic idea                                                                                                                                                   | Third Way idea                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Top-down state intervention is needed. A mixed economy with economic management is needed. The free-market must be rejected.                                             | The boots actually taste really nice, you know?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Economies should have strong focus on industry and factories (making products using skills). There should be less focus in services (making services using information). | We should educate everyone to create a competitive, knowledge-based, service based economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Society is based around class: your human nature is greatly influenced by your class.                                                                                    | society is based around groups, but these groups are now communities. These communities might be based on a local area, age, ethnicity, sexuality, including others. People are shaped by their communities, and have a responsibility to care for their communities. You can be a member of more than one. |
| There is conflict between the classes, but the conflict is not severe and can be managed, so that the working class get a ‘good deal’ from society and the state.        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Welfare is a very good idea. Everybody deserves to be looked after from cradle to grave. The neo-liberal idea of having to stand on your own two feet is cruel.          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
