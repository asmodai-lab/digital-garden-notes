## What do one-nation conservatives believe?
- prevent a revolution AT ALL COSTS
- the rich have obligations 
- civilise other peoples around the world
- limit the free market

### Why do they believe this?
It's the 1850s in Britain! Everything is absolutely shit for the working-class! New ideologies are popping up — some that promise to overthrow the aristocracy! The aristocracy (who are conservatives) see this and absolutely shit themselves! 

So, they disagree with traditional conservatives. 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it', yes, but it's broke, so fix it! Also, avoid a fucking revolution! Partly because when a revolution goes to shit, that affects the working-class the most (because the aristocracy can leg it), and also because the revolution is targeting them, and they REALLY don't want to lose all their power/wealth.
