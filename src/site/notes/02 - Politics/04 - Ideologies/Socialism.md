| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| State        | State is completely evil, but is needed during the revolutionary phase in order to defend from internal and external threats — but it will eventually disappear and people will live in communes. This state will be a dictatorship of the proletariat. | State is necessary in order to help people. Big government yay. | State is big.                                                                  |           |
| Society      | Capitalism will eventually oroboros itself as the capitalist class becomes smaller over time and the proletariat will finally grow so angry that they do a revolution.                                                                                  | Crime is caused by social causes.                               | Crime is caused by a mix of social causes and free will.                       |           |
| Human Nature | Human nature is corrupted because we are alienated from our work and forced to be greedy by capitalism.                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                 |                                                                                |           |
| the economy  | because wealth can not be created, someone who becomes wealthier becomes so because somebody else becomes poorer.                                                                                                                                       |                                                                 | Mixed economy — capitalism can create wealth but unregulated causes suffering. |           |
