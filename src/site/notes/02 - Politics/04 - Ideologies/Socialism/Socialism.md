| State        | State is completely evil, but is needed during the revolutionary phase in order to defend from internal and external threats — but it will eventually disappear and people will live in communes. This state will be a dictatorship of the proletariat. | State is big. Extensive, non-means tested welfare state; 'from the cradle to the grave' | Still wants a welfare state to support those on the edges but it shouldn't be provided to lazy people or criminals or people who have enough money.                                                    |
| Society      | Capitalism will eventually oroboros itself as the capitalist class becomes smaller over time and the proletariat will finally grow so angry that they do a revolution.                                                                                  | Crime is caused by a mix of social causes and free will.                                | Still want to focus on the causes of crime but bigger focus on individual responsibility.                                                                                                              |
| Human Nature | Human nature is corrupted because we are alienated from our work and forced to be greedy by capitalism.                                                                                                                                                 | Class defines your human nature.                                                        | Class doesn't really exist, actually we are all part of multiple 'groups' (club, family, race, religion, etc etc). People suffer because they are on the edges of society, not because of their class. |
| the economy  | because wealth can not be created, someone who becomes wealthier becomes so because somebody else becomes poorer.                                                                                                                                       | Mixed economy — capitalism can create wealth but unregulated causes suffering.          | Free market economy with minimal nationalisation and low regulations, low taxes, and restrictions on trade unions in order to encourage wealth creation.                                               |
### Tenets of Socialism
- collectivism - *to cover how collective human effort is both of greater practical value to the economy and moral value to society than the effort of individuals*
- common humanity - *to cover the nature of humans as social creatures with a tendency to co-operation, sociability and rationality, and how the individual cannot be understood without reference to society, as human behaviour is socially determined*
- equality - *is a fundamental value of socialism – to cover the disagreements among socialists about the nature of equality and how it is critical to the state, society, the economy and human nature*
- social class - *a group of people in society who have the same socioeconomic status – to cover the extent to which class impacts on socialists’ views of society, the state and the economy*
- worker's control - *to cover the importance and the extent of control over the economy and/or state and how it is to be achieved*

### Thinkers
**Karl Marx (1818–83) and Friedrich Engels (1820–95)**
- The centrality of social class – the ideas of historical materialism, dialectic change and revolutionary class consciousness.
- Humans as social beings – how nature is socially determined and how true common humanity can be expressed only under communism.
**Beatrice Webb (1858–1943)**
- ‘The inevitability of gradualness’ – the gradualist parliamentary strategy for achieving evolutionary socialism.
- The expansion of the state – that this, and not the overthrow of the state, is critical in delivering socialism.
**Rosa Luxemburg (1871–1919)**
- Evolutionary socialism and revisionism – this is not possible as capitalism is based on an economic relationship of exploitation.
- Struggle by the proletariat for reform and democracy – this creates the class consciousness necessary for the overthrow of the capitalist society and state.
**Anthony Crosland (1918–77)**
- The inherent contradictions in capitalism – does not drive social change and managed capitalism can deliver social justice and equality.
- State-managed capitalism – includes the mixed economy, full employment and universal social benefits.
**Anthony Giddens (1938– )**
- The rejection of state intervention – acceptance of the free market in the economy, emphasis on equality of opportunity over equality, responsibility and community over class conflict.
- The role of the state – is social investment in infrastructure and education not economic and social engineering
