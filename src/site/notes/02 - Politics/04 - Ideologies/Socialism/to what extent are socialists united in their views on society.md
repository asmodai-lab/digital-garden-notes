| View on class is entirely different                                                                                          | Marx has a hard view of class, SDs are 'yeah, generally' and TW is communitarian                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Marx's view of class was because of historical materialism, he thought that an 'upper and lower' class were constants in society, and black and white.                                               | Generally, they all agree that 'groups' of people exist. Even in the TW, these are somewhat economic (education level)                                                          |
| *SW and TW are similar in state's necessity (Marx is somewhat)*<br>(this point is irrelevant to society, it's a state point) | *Both SD and TW think that a govt. is necessary for society to function (RS thinks this but only for the revolutionary period) and that it should be non-violent.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | *Crosland thinks that the state has benefits, in organising society and driving change in a way that anarchy cannot. (Marx somewhat agrees that govt is needed for order)*                           | *However, what the state should and shouldn't do and how long it exists for is completely different across S ideas — specifically in the 'necessary evil' idea not found in TW* |
| The way they want to address inequality is completely different (because of their views on class and economy)                | Marx thinks that a revolution is necessary. SD's advocate 'social justice' (i.e. valuing stability once fairness has reached an acceptable level) and TW thinks that — since class doesn't really exist — people are responsible for their situation in a way that is not found in RS or SD                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Rosa Luxemburg thought that achieving equality by changing the state is not possible because capitalism is reliant on exploitation — which dramatically changes how one would respond to inequality. | They all agree on helping people? But this doesn't matter in the face of their methods, which are completely different.                                                         |
| Extent of equality needed is completely different                                                                            | Marx needs entire equality, SDs prefer equality of income but will go towards stability at a certain point (although welfare state exists), TW thinks that the state should help some but more in a 'workfare' sense. This is because their view on how much our economic situation is responsible for our actions is very different (from 'all' with Marx to 'a tad' with TW) This is because how much unfairness they are willing to tolerate for a stable society is completely different | Giddens thinks that state intervention discourages wealth creation, which is better for everyone **on average** than state intervention, even if it causes minor inequality.                         | but they all want an amount of equality for everyone, no matter their characteristics. This is weak tho because their stable-fair ratios are completely different.              |
