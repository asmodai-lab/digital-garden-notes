Ask yourself these questions as you read material from revision guides, textbooks and your own notes. Try to answer as many as you can.

They can be used as the themes for essay paragraphs. If doing so, consider which three are best to talk about for the question. Consider which would give the best overview of the ideology.

## Human Nature

- **Group identity:** What groups do people form into? Do people even form into groups?
- **Qualification for group membership:** What makes people a member of a group? Do they share one characteristic?
- **Principle motivation underpinning human nature:** Do human beings want one thing more than anything else? Are we striving for a particular goal? Are there any situations that humans really hate and really want to avoid?
- **Extent to which human beings are self-interested:** How nice are people? Selfish or selfless?
- **Extent to which human nature is malleable:** How much does environment matter? Are we born nasty or do we become it?
- **Trigger for group formation:** When do groups form? Is there a specific moment/event?
- **Extent of group size:** How big do groups get?

## Society

- **Degree of co-operation and conflict:** How do human beings act towards each other? Do we form groups or like staying as individuals?
- **Extent of hierarchy in society:** Does society have a hierarchy? _Should_ it have a hierarchy? If there is a hierarchy, what things/idea is that hierarchy based upon – and what keeps the hierarchy in place?
- **Extent to which society should change:** Should society change? If it should, how will the new society look compared to the old one?
- **Extent of diversity within society:** Are there different groups in society? How do these groups interact with each other? How _should_ these groups act towards each other? What do groups form around?
- **Extent of societal obligation to the individual:** How much is society responsible for the individual? ‘Care for us form cradle to grave’ or is there ‘no such thing as society’?
- **Extent of equality that should exist in society:** Equality of opportunity, equality of outcome, neither or a bit of both?

## State

- **Control of the state:** Who controls the state? Who _should_ control the state?
- **Primary purpose of the state:** What is the main purpose of the state? Why is a state even needed? Should the state try to make the world more equal, stable or free?
- **Extent to which the state should be reformed:** Should the state be reformed/changed? What’s wrong with the current state? What would a new state look like, and why will this be better? How should the state be changed – gradually through democracy or radically through violent revolution?
- **Extent to which the state should promote equality:** Should the state promote equality? If so, what types of equality? Why not other types? Should the state resist promoting equality, and instead encourage hierarchy? Why?
- **Extent of the role of the state in the economy:** What type of economy should there be – planned, mixed or free market? Why? And why not the others?
- **Extent to which the state should try to engineer societal structure:** How many tiers should society have? How different should those tiers be from each? How can the state encourage them to become closer? How can the state maintain appropriate distance between them?
- **Nature of the transitions of power:** How should we pick who is in control of the state? Is it done by a natural hierarchy, or elections, or revolution?
- **Extent of state power:** How powerful should the state be? If it should be weak, how should it be controlled? If the state should be strong, why does it need to be strong?
- **Extent to which the state facilitates freedom:** Does the state give people freedom, or take it away?
- **Extent to which the state should promote one moral way of life:** Should the state encourage people to have certain moral values – or allow people to decide morality for themselves?
- **Extent to which the state should punish criminals:** How tough should the state be on people who break its laws? (Siberian concentration camps or Scandinavian open prisons?)  
  

## Economy

- **Primary purpose of economic activity:** Is the economy about maximising people’s freedom (generally liberal), encouraging equality (generally socialist), or maintaining stability (generally conservative)? What is the goal of managing the economy
- **Structure of the economy:** Free-market, mixed or planned? Which is best and why do they think it? Why od they reject the other ones? Was Keynes (mixed economy) right or wrong? Why?
- **Extent and nature of support for the poor:** How much welfare should there be? Why that amount? Why not more? Why not less? How generous should welfare be? Why?
- **Conception of property:** What are their attitudes to property? Do they want private property? Common ownership? What should be privately owned or commonly owned? Why do they have those views towards property? What alternative are they rejecting?
- **Effects of resources on human nature:** To what extent does the economy affect our human nature?
- **Extent to which economics affects society:**  How does economics affect social structure? Where is this beneficial? Where is this detrimental? What should the state do to prevent those detrimental situations?
