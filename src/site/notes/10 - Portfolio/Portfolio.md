This is the home note for my portfolio. This works similar to Wikipedia, where there are links to each related note, of which you just have to click on. 

The reason this is not on artstation or any other social media is due to the fact that some of this is A-Level work, which cannot appear on social media. Here is a [link to my artstation](https://www.artstation.com/leahjohnston), although it's not set up for my portfolio.
