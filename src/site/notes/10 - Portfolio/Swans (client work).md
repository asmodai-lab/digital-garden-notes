## Basic context

A while ago, I was asked by a teacher to design small logos for our types of house-points in school (like 'brave', 'reflective', 'knowledgeable', etc. House-points are awarded in those categories, and they have logos on the house-point stickers.)

I did an initial client briefing with him (the teacher) where I showed him various thumbnails for the logos, colour scheme, and text font. He picked a few and I finished those.

A few weeks later, he tells me that he showed them to the headmistress, who liked them but wanted more input. There was a second client meeting, where I ran her by the things I showed to the teacher, and the idea of a larger piece illustrating all of the house-point qualities together was proposed.

So I started the whole process over with the bigger piece (thumbnails, colour scheme, style, etc). I have been giving regular updates on it as to allow continual feedback.
