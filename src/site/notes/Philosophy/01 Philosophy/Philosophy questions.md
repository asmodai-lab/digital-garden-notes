# Nature and attributes of God

```exercise
Aquinas speaks of two Analogies, what are these? $line{"Proportion", "Attribution"} and $line{"Proportion", "Attribution"}
Give an example for both: for A- $input{"analogy of the baker", "analogy of the bull"}, for Pr- $input{"analogy of the guitarist", "analogy of the dog"}

Brummer is critical about analogy because we cannot make claims about $input{God}.

Barth is critical about analogy because it suggests that we can't come to God through experience. What do we need? $input{"revelation", "revalation"}.

How can we refer to positive language? Via $input{affirmativa} or the $input{cataphatic} way.

How can we refer to negative language? Via $input{negativa} or the $input{apophatic} way.
