## Plato on Dualism


> [!QUOTE] Plato, ‘Phaedo’
> “The body is the source of endless trouble to us… takes away from us all power of thinking at all” 

Plato is the original dualist. He believes that the body and soul are separate, and that the soul lives on after the death of the body.

### Plato's principles on body and soul 
1. **body and soul are opposites** —  material and imperfect versus spiritual and perfect. They are two separate substances that interact.
2. **Changing** — the body is constantly changing so cannot be a source of truth. The soul is immortal, in the world of forms, unchanging, and a source of truth
3. **The soul is the real identity of a person** — we have a body, but we aren't a body: our inner mental life is the most important part of ourselves. 
4. **In conflict** — soul seeks intellectual pleasure. Monkey brain want physical pleasure. Conflict. 
5. **Charioteer** — reason is the highest thing and allows us to know the world of forms, emotion inspires us but can make us reckless, appetites ensure we look after our bodies but can lead us into hedonism. A good person is one with reason in charge.
6. **Forms** — soul is in a higher reality and wants to return to the world of forms. We have knowledge because our soul has experienced it in the world of forms.
7. **Mortality** — anything material cannot be everlasting, permanence is part of the 'true essence' and the soul is immortal, so it's purer, cannot be broken down, and must carry on living. 

### Plato's actual arguments
**The cyclical argument** — if birth leads to death, then death must lead to birth. 
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">This is 'begging the question' (fallacy)</span>
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Also, this is <i>cum hoc ergo propter hoc</i>: correlation does not equal causation. Just because life is linked to death, does not mean death is linked to life.</span>

**The recollection argument** — all knowledge is just stuff you remember.
> How can a child learn so quickly? They must know it from a previous life.
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">This is a <i>non sequitur</i> fallacy, or a faulty generalisation fallacy: the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premises/ the conclusion is based on weak premises.</span>

**The affinity argument** — The soul survives death. Since the body is mortal and composed of many parts, the soul — which is not composed of many parts — must be immortal.
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">This is a false dilemma, (the soul and body are opposites) into <i>affirming the consequent</i> (<i>if A then B; B, therefore A</i> — if death (A) follows from life (B), then life must follow from death)</span>

**The argument from opposites** — since death is the opposite of life, and opposites are mutually exclusive, when the body dies life must go on. *This is just the cyclical argument part 2.*
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">again, begging the question</span> 

# Descartes

Descartes believes that the mind is **interdependent**, the mind and soul (which he does not make distinction between) are where all thoughts/sensations/ideas occur.

>[!QUOTE]
> The soul has "thought but not extension" and the body has "extension but not thought."

He believes that the mind/soul interact with the body through the 'pineal gland' in the brain. This is, of course, complete crap. He called this complete crap **Cartesian Dualism**.
> For more info, read [this article](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/states-mind/ghost-and-princess), it goes more into depth on his position. It's quite short and a good read.


# Property dualism
> [!SUMMARY]
> The body and soul are different but interact as part of the same substance — i.e. when the body dies, the soul dies.

## Aristotle
- the body is matter and the soul is the form
	- the soul shapes the body, gives it it's qualities/purpose; the soul is the Formal, Efficient, and Final cause.
- The soul cannot act without a body, and a body cannot act without a soul.
	- the soul and body are inseparable because they interact so closely.

#### The eye and axe analogies
>The eye is simply an object. It's Formal cause is 'sight.' There is no 'eye' without the action of sight

>What makes up an axe is not only it's materials, but it's 'capacity to chop.' This is it's Formal cause
>>The soul is the Formal cause of the body

### Aquinas
- bro just agrees with Aristotle but adds Christianity onto it.
		- *He uses Aristotle's arguments for the existence of a soul but then completely ignores the ones which indicate that the soul does not survive death.*
	- the soul is united with it's resurrection body to enjoy heaven/the kingdom of God after death.
> Although he adds that the soul operates independently, and so can survive death.

## The 'G' in Gilbert Ryle stands for 'Goat'
Ryle criticises Descartes' substance dualism using the analogy of "**ghost in the machine**"
>i.e. they can't be separate if they interact.
>>> *If you read the article on Descartes above, it provides a lot more depth to these arguments.*

He also uses the idea of a '**category error**'
- A category error is like when - after being shown around one building in a university, you say 'can I see the university now?'
- actions have to be of both the body and mental state — they cannot be separated and categorised into different things **because they are sub-elements of the same thing**
	- *this links back to Aristotle's ideas*

Finally, he uses the **Holistic argument**: i.e. looking at a person as a whole; he thinks that the body and soul are one thing.
> This is the weakest argument. Don't use it unless you agree with dualism and want a bad argument on the opposite side to counter. 


# Various other philosophers on mind-body-soul 

## John Hick
- the soul is a gift from God (Aquinas)
- "my soul is not me" — without the physical body, you wouldn't be identifiable, you need **both** parts (Aristotle)
- the body has a spiritual dimension: the soul (???)

## Elizabeth Anscombe
- **purpose influence** — we have reasons behind our actions, reasons behind our thought processes. 
	- *"bodily is an act of man qua spirit."*
- The body and soul relate to each other in order to make a human being

# Skinner and Behaviourism

Behaviourism is a type of materialism. 
- it posits that thoughts are just learned behaviours: mental acts are explainable at a physical level which would direct to not believing in a soul that directs us. 
	- see the Pavlov's dogs experiments for examples of learned mental behaviours
	- also see that our brain takes a lot of shortcuts to function. It is a tad crazy how much we work on assumptions. 

## Why do we need to have a soul?

### Hard problem of conciousness
This was created by David Chalmers. He argues that bodily function alone cannot explain the depth of human conciousness — so therefore there must be a soul/ some separate substance.
> You could, if you wanted to, counter this with the argument from ignorance fallacy: just because you can't prove it, doesn't mean it isn't true.

### Other philosphers
**Daniel C. Dennett**
- humans can't be reduced to learned behaviours, Skinner's reasons would only be correct if Dennett's explanation of something stopped at having a desire — but our thinking goes much further.
	- Skinner oversimplifies human conciousness — to him there is no difference between human or pigeon

**John Cottingham**
- If we are just mind and body, no soul — it doesn't make sense: the human experiences of passion, emotions, and sensations cannot be reduced to either category.
