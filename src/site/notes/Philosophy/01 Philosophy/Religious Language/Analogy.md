# Worksheet questions

***According to Aquinas, we can say positive/affirmative things about god.***
	Under what condition?
		Aquinas says that via positiva can be used when it is expressly analogy.

***Aquinas was opposed to using univocal and equivocal language when talking about God***
	Why did he reject this?
		Univocal language is too limiting of an infinite God, equivocal language does not allow us to gain knowledge of God through reason because of subjectivity. 
	Example of equivocal language
		Table, punch, illness, etc
***The same word when applied to God means something totally different when applied to human beings.*** 
	Why did Aquinas reject this?
		Because it doesn't allow us to gain knowledge through reason


***Instead, Aquinas recommended analogical language.***
	What assumption does Aquinas make?
		That God can be understood/that human language can understand God
***Aquinas distinguished between two types***
1. Analogy of attribution - *we ascribe a quality to one thing because it is caused by another.*
	For example, a skilled baker makes loaf of bread. We ascribe that the bread is good because the baker is skilled. 
		What is Aquinas' Analogy of the Bull?
			If the bulls urine is healthy then the bull is healthy, and if the bull is healthy then the urine must be healthy.
	Similarly, God produces everything in the world.
		What do we mean when we say God is 'good, wise and loving.'
			God is the source of 'good, wise and loving' — he is perfectly all of these things all of the time. This is basically Plato's idea of forms.
	<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ALTHOUGH, just because he has those attributes, doesn't mean he is the source of those</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">attributes</span>
 
***Analogy of proportion***
	We ascribe a quality to one thing because it points towards another thing which has that quality. The words that relate to objects are different in proportion.
			Give an example>
				The dog is clever, but only as clever as dogs go — and the scientist is clever (which is compared to other people.)
	How can a mother's love for her daughter point to divine love?
		Human love points to divine love, like how dog's cleverness points to human cleverness

***Is analogy a clear way of understanding God?***

A more modern version of the idea of speaking about God with analogy comes from **Ian Ramsey**. He tried to explain the way that religious language could usefully describe God, by using '**models and qualifiers.**'

A model assists us to understand the thing that it represents, it is an analogy to help us express something about God. 'God is good' contains the model 'good.' We understand the human concept of goodness, and we apply it as a model to understand the nature of God. 
	Why do we need to adapt the model?
		Because God is infinite, and humans are finite
	What does the qualifier do?
		The qualifier is how we adapt the model- to make it infinite.

(model can also be caused 'ideal/idea')

| Model    | Qualifier                                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Cause    | God is uncaused, God is the causer ()                |
| Wise     | Omniscience                                          |
| Good     | Perfect and unending — God is the source of goodness |
| Creation | Created everything, including non-physical things    |
The model is our understanding of a word. It is like a toy plane to a toy man — the toy man can understand the concept of a plane, but cannot comprehend the scale of a real plane — the qualifier is what the toy man uses to explain that there is an uncomprehend-able difference in scale. *We use qualifiers to apply our human concepts to God.*


***what are the strengths of using analogy?***

1. Acknowledges the flawed and unnuanced nature of human language.
2. Allows us to gain knowledge of God through reason, using language as the tool.

***What are the weaknesses of using analogy?***

1. It's still using human language. It can explicitly never be a perfect description, and so can never be accurate.
2. Epistemic gap
3. Still using equivocal language


# Test of knowledge

1. Aquinas speaks of two Analogies, what are these? *Attribution and proportion.*
	1. Example for each analogy — *analogy of the Bull for attribution, analogy of the dog for proportion.*
2. Brummer is critical of this was because he says we are not entitled to make claims about *God.*
3. Barth is critical of analogy because it suggests we can't come to God through experience. What do we need? *Revelation.*
4. Positive language can also be called *cataphatic* or *via affirmativa*
5. Negative language can be called *apophatic* or *via negativa*
6. Name someone connected to the apophatic way. *Maimonides or Pseudo Dionysus*
7. If one realises the transcendence of God, one will realise the limitations of expressing anything about God, so one might liken this way to the via *negativa.*
8. All that encounter the mystery of God will realise the limitations of language and this will apply to both the *cataphatic* and *apophatic* way.
