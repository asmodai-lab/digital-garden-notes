##### **What does it mean when philosophers call God simple?** 

**Augustine:** God=unchangeable... therefore he can't lose or gain characteristics, because he is perfect. 

**Aquinas** meant by saying God is simple means he is just 'being/existing'
- God is immaterial
- he has no body with no characteristics
- God is simply God
	- God's nature and his existence are the same thing: so to talk of God is to talk of a being that exists
	- God is not a kind of thing
Davies
. God is not a thing like a human being but God is a thing in the same sense that one might talk about 'the human race' as a whole. 
- anything that changes is part of the world and not distinct from it, as God is. If something changeable accounted for there being a world where change occurs, it would be part of that world and couldn't therefore account for it
- **God is the source of change.**

**Anselm** says that existence is a predicate

------------
## Terminology 

The discussion of eternal v. everlasting is important because it defines how God views time. 

Eternal is **existing outside of time**
Everlasting is **existing as long as time exists** 

- The difference between philosophy and theology is that theology is specifically studying from inside the religion, and philosophy is from outside, **or**: God can exist outside of Christianity (philosophy), but Christianity cannot exist without a God. 

==Existentialism== is a philosophy that emphasizes individual existence, freedom and choice. It is the view that humans define their own meaning in life, and try make rational decisions despite existing in an irrational universe. 

Simple (definition)- God is God, and cannot be explained in terms of parts or characteristics. 

What does this mean? The traditional understanding of God is as unchanging, not having parts or characteristics.
