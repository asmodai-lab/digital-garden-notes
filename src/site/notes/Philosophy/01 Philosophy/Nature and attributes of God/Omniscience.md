[[Omniscience LoA.canvas|Omniscience LoA]]

### Problem of free will
- if God knew you were going to eat cornflakes tomorrow morning, could you be free to choose differently?
- could you have toast instead?
	- if God knows everything, does this include events in the future as well as the past? If he does, then it suggests that the future is fixed and we have no free will. 
		- ==If we have free will, then we cannot be blamed or praised for our actions
==Religion teaches that God gave us free will, so that we may make our own decisions, decide our own futures, with no coercion from God

If God knows all things throughout time (as he must if he is omniscient) then he knows every action I perform, every decision I make throughout my life, before I have done them. 

- If God knows everything, then he must know what I am going to do before I do it.
- For example, that I am going to drink this glass of water. If God knows it, then it must be true that I drink the water. If it's true that I drink the water, then it can't be false that I drink the water. That means |I have no choice, I will drink the water. This means either God is omniscient but we lack free will or we have free will but God is not omniscient (and therefore not God)
- one response to this is to argue that God's omniscience extends to all things that are possible to know, but free will makes it impossible to know the future
- Also- a God that makes a soul that is guaranteed to go to hell and suffer for eternity is evil.
- If God knows everything, how do we know he hasn't also predetermined those things?

#### Problem of evil yippee
- if god is 'eternal' and our behavior is predetermined or foreseen, then is God partly responsible for evil actions brought about by our free choices?
- Can he be omni-benevolent? If he can foresee evil then why does he not prevent it?
##### Boethius (the bitch)

In his book 'The Consolation of Philosophy'- Lady Philosophy states God's foreknowledge isn't the cause of future events happening
- God is eternal but we still have freedom- he says that God's knowledge is **causal**- he sees the future but in doing so is simply foreseeing the actions that humans choose out of free will


### Augustine
- if you have a friend that you know very well, you may know that he is about to sin. But your knowledge does not cause him to sin. Similarly God doesn't cause someone to sin but sees beforehand those who are going to sin by their own will.
- BUT
- this analogy is unfair; the foreknowledge of the friend and of God are different. The former cannot be wrong, whereas human foreknowledge can
### Aquinas
- built upon Boethius- God takes in all history as a whole, he has a 'birds-eye' perspective. God looks down from above at what choices will be made but this knowledge of the choices that will be made isn't casual- free choices can still be made
