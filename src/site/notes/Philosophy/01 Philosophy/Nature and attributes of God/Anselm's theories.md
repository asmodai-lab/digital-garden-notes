### Anselm's four dimensional approach to the timelessness of God
- he uses Boethius
- develops the idea of seeing "all moments" of time at once at all times
But he sees human existence like this:
	For us humans, only the present moment exists; the past is gone; the future hasn't happened; the only reality is the present. We cannot go back to change something and we cannot know what will happen next week because it doesn't exist.
#### Four dimensionalist

1. height
2. width
3. depth
4. time (different to how you would hear people talk about the 4th dimension now: instead they would use the word duration.)
- Yesterday, the past, next week and the future are relative terms for the person who is doing the perceiving at any given moment.
- Our imagination struggles with past/present/future existing at the same time
	- For Anselm, the eternal present of God is not the same thing as "our present"
	- eternity is a non-temporal concept which in Anselm's understanding is in the Fourth dimension
- Humans exist in a particular place in space and time. We have a different view of if something is near or far depending on where we are.
	- ITS THE FUCKING EPISTEMIC GAP YOU MOTHERFUCKER
	- God is unlimited by space and time- he is limitless

## Katherine Rogers

-> Although the points of a circle's circumference are all in different places relative to one another, they all share the same relationship with the centre of the circle; likewise, God shares the same relationship with each and every point in time

### Second analogy

- is between a mountain climber surveying a landscape and God surveying time: just as a mountain climber can see the entire landscape from the summit of the mountain, so can God see each and every moment in time stretched out before him from his vantage point.

### Free will?

- does God's foreknowledge of our actions allow free will?
	- God's eternity is the 4th dimension: he knows our future as unchanged whereas we inside time see the future changing because of our choice
	- this means Anselm does not deny the reality of our temporal world but God is in a non-temporal world
- God can justifiably judge us because we are morally responsible
	- we have chosen freely and God can see at all times. This is all happening, "at the same time, it exists simultaneously in an eternal presence"
#### Watch your language!

- since we have no other vocabulary, it means we find it difficult to grasp God's knowledge and action so it is difficult for us to talk about the fourth dimension
- One question might be- how can God be part of our world if the eternity of God is in another dimension?
	- consider:
		- the significance of Jesus
		- what happens when we pray
		- is God a personal God if he is in another dimension?
## Swinburne's criticisms

"the worst person you know just made a great point." :(

Summary of key points
- it's unbiblical
- logically incoherent
- makes no sense in light of worship and prayer
### Hezekiah (Bible story)

In those days, Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amos went to him and said, "This is what the Lord says; put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover."
Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord "remember Lord, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah. "Go and tell Hezekiah, 'this is what the Lord, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add 15 years to your life."

--------
Often in the Old testament, God pronounces judgement and then forgives people and allows them a fresh start. This judgement culminates in Jesus' death and resurrection. 

- Swinburne points out that when Christians worship and pray they are interacting with God and speak of a personal relationship
	- "A totally immutable God is a lifeless God."
However, in this verse, God has perfect knowledge of what he will do and his intentions are fixed or his views are fixed. 
	- 'Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?'
This verse suggests divine timelessness:
- '"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the almighty."'
-----------------
A loving God cannot be immutable (even is he loves unconditionally.) A loving relationship responds to the subject of their love as a process and sequence of events.
