##### What can God not do?
> We need to know the various ideas of God as omnipotent- i.e. divine power and self limitation
> We need to answer the question of 'whether it is possible or necessary to resolve the apparent conflicts between divine attributes.

### Logical problems

- can God create a stone too heavy for himself to lift, or a knot which he cannot untie?
- is God's omnipotence compatible with his omni-benevolence? For example, would it be illogical for God  to be able to do evil (*as he can do anything*) and unable to do evil (*as he is perfectly good*)
#### Problem of evil problems

In an example raised by ==Michael Dummett== : 'You hear the news that the ship your loved ones were on, sank two hours ago, with few survivors.'
- Does it make sense to pray in this situation?
- could God change what happened, or is your loved one safe because God knew that you would pray?
	- How would a religious believer answer this question?

### God's omnipotence in theodicies
Both Anselm and Descartes rely on God's omnipotence for their theodicies
- **Anselm** says that God is '*that which nothing greater can be conceived*'- and that God has all perfections, including existence. If God was anything less than omnipotent then we could conceive of a greater, more powerful being; so God, by definition must be omnipotent
- Descartes says that yes, God can do absolutely anything
#### Aquinas
- God is immaterial, he has no body with characteristics- 'God is God'
- Anselm says that God's nature and his existence are the same thing- to talk of God is to talk of a being that exists
- (also, God can only do what is logically possible)
	- he says that to do the logically impossible is meaningless
	- It adds nothing to God's power to do the logically impossible
	- '**Meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire a meaning because we prefix them two other words: 'God can"**'
#### Davies
God is not a think like a human being but God is a thing in the same sense that one might talk about 'THE human race' as a while
- anything that changes is part of the world and not distinct from it, as God is. If something changeable accounted for their being a world were change occurs, it would be part of that world and couldn't therefore account for it. 

## But I am the devil from the ~Bible~
- the bible has no support for God not being able to do the logically impossible

|   Vardy    | God's ability to act is limited- if God acted in any other way, everything would not be able to exist the way that it does. | Why can I never escape the epistemic gap?      |                                                                                                                                                              |
| Macquarrie | God's power is very different from our own- God's nature will always be partly unknowable to us.                            | WHY CAN I NEVER ESCAPE THE EPISTEMIC GAP!!!!!! |                                                                                                                                                              |

|   Geach    | God's omnipotence is power **over everything** rather than power to **do everything**                                       |                                                |                                                                                                                                                              |
| Descartes  | Agrees with Anselm- God can do absolutely everything.                                                                       |                                                | Then why can't he stop suffering but create free beings? (i.e. problem of evil. Again)<br>Also- if he can do the logically impossible, how can we trust him? |
