[[Philosophy/03 DCT/01 Gender and Society/Feminism\|Feminism]] 
- to become woman is to become *'Other'*, considered second to men, and systematically blocked from pursuing freedom. 
- 
(She wrote a book called 'the second sex', it is considered a foundational feminist work)
- Her live remains controversial, because while she was a teacher, she was accused of sexual misconduct and was fired. 
- Her work does not discuss race, class, and intersectionality.

- How each writer understands gender and its formation. 

- Points of similarity and difference. 

- How these ideas challenge traditional views of gender.

Extracts 

1. Woman as “Other” 

	**Beauvoir – The Second Sex** 
	
	“One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is **civilization** as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between **male and eunuch,** which is described as feminine.” 
	
	**Butler – Gender Trouble** 
	
	“Gender is the repeated stylization of the body, a set of repeated acts within a highly rigid regulatory frame that congeal over time to produce the **appearance of substance** — of a natural sort of being.”

2. Social Construction 

	**Beauvoir – The Second Sex** 
	
	“Thus humanity is male, and man defines woman not in herself but relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being. … He is the Subject, he is the Absolute — she is the Other.” 
	
	**Butler – Gender Trouble** 
	
	“When the constructed status of gender is theorized as radically independent of sex, gender itself becomes a free-floating artifice, with the consequence that man and masculine might just as easily signify a female body as a male one, and woman and feminine a male body as easily as a female one.”

3. The Problem of Identity 

	**Beauvoir – The Second Sex** 
	
	“Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with absolute truth.” 
	
	**Butler – Gender Trouble** 
	
	“There is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; … identity is performatively constituted by the very ‘expressions’ that are said to be its results.”

Reflection Questions 

1. What does Beauvoir mean by “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman”? How does this relate to Butler’s idea of gender as performative? 
	> Beauvoir means to say that society as a whole creates gender and enforces it onto women. Butler's is similar- but is more the idea that 'femininity' isn't real- it is women trying to express themselves through a rigid framework. Although Beauvoir's idea's are more signifying the 'second sex', meanwhile Butler says that gender identity isn't real in the first place. 

2. How do both writers challenge the idea that gender is natural? 
    > both writers put forward the idea that gender is created and not inherent- Beauvoir in that women are 'the second sex', which is a completely different idea to Christo-centric ideas of man and woman as two halves of the same whole. Butler goes further to say that gender is entirely constructed, and not inherent. 

3. Where do you see Beauvoir laying the groundwork for Butler? Where does Butler go further? 
    > Beauvoir mostly talks about the oppression of women through our gender, that being oppressed is an inherent characteristic of being a woman. Butler goes further in fully saying that gender does not exist in the slightest, that it is nothing but a tool for oppression. 

4. How might these ideas connect to debates today about gender identity and social roles?
	> they are both, quite radically, saying that gender does not exist at all AND that it is used as a tool for oppression. This is especially pertinent to the TERF ideology: of gender essentialism and anti-transgender rhetoric, which is (although not obviously, but still very strongly) related inherently to Butler's and Beauvoir's ideas. Because TERF's are 'protecting' gender essentialism, they are essentially the anti-feminists, and it is a misnomer to call them feminists at all, because they clearly do not understand [[Philosophy/03 DCT/01 Gender and Society/Feminism\|Feminism]]'s ideas.
