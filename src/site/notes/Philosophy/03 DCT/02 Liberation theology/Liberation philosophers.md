| **Should the church be political?**                                       | everything is political- even not involving oneself in politics                                                                                               | REFER TO PHILOSPHERS BELOW FOR ALL OF THESE. |
| **Should the church focus on the poor?**                                  | Oppression is intersectional. The poor are also most often also members of other oppressed groups- because the class system is used to oppress the oppressed. |                                              |
| **Should the church engage in political methodology?**                    | the church does not focus on ruling- because they already have a king. They are just ambassadors for the kingdom of God.                                      |                                              |

| **Should the church focus on structural sin rather than individual sin?** | Structural sin is the cause of individual sin. The thief only steals because he does not have enough money, etc.                                              |                                              |
| **Should the church be more focussed on action or prayer?**               | Jesus rarely prays in the Bible: he acts to better society instead.                                                                                           |                                              |

## Definitions that need to be accounted for: (see later section)


>Marxism
>Violence (political violence/actualised violence/systemic violence)
>Oppression- (do research into classism)
>Liberation theology

# Pope John Paul 2nd

**Preferential option for the poor.**

"Constant concern for and dedication to categories of people who are especially beloved to the Lord Jesus."

He went on to explain that the advancement of the poor constitutes a great opportunity for the moral, cultural, and economic growth for all of humanity. 

However, he makes it clear that: *spiritual poverty can be caused by an over-emphasis on material goods and consumerism. It is right and proper for the church to concentrate on both spiritual and material matters.*


## Marx and Restrepo

Revolution begins with philosophers having solidarity with the oppressed.

Marx thinks that the only way to cause change was through 'despotic inroads' (violence)

The 'preferential treatment for the poor' is indebted to Marx as it awakens the conscience of those in power to force the church into a struggle against injustice. 

**'Words without action are empty. Revolution, even violence, may be needed in order to make the people free.'** - Camilo Torres Restrepo

### Is it right for Christians to prioritise one group over another?


| Yes, it is right                                                                                                                                                                                                               | No, it is wrong                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Boff argues that God does not sit back, dispassionate and disengaged with the world, but gets involved, and sides with the poor.                                                                                               | The vatican claims that Liberation theology manifests a dangerous preoccupation with the poor and oppressed in Latin America. Although the poor should be helped, prioritising one group is wrong. |
| Gutierrez says that god: "takes sides with the poor and liberates them from slavery and oppression [...] the reciprocal relationship between God and the poor person is the very heart of biblical faith."                     | Jesus' message was for all- we are all to be saved. Emphasising one group is dangerous because it forgets the universal nature of salvation.                                                       |
| Poverty has a special status in Christianity- e.g. vows of poverty. It would be easier for a camel to go through an eye of a needle than for a rigch man to enter heaven, etc.                                                 | John Paul 2 points to the idea that wealth does not shelter us from spiritual poverty. Rich people can be as unhappy as the poor.                                                                  |
| The kingdom of heaven belongs to the oppressed- notably the poor. "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God" (Luke) "but woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort" (also Luke) | Jesus does not idealise the poor. His aims for abundance are or everyone. He invites us to share what we have with the poor.                                                                       |


## The church's concern with liberation theology

The church became concerned with liberation theology's use of Marx's theories and cardinal Ratzinger made the Church's disquiet known.

Some felt that Marx's theories were the only immediate effective response but this could be dangerous. 

"The Marxist ideology is wrong. But I have met many Marxists in my life who are good people, so I don't feel offended." - Pope Francis

# Critics
## Kloppenburg (always a critic)


He has concerns. Here they are:

- Liberation theology emphasis practical opposition to oppression above the message of the gospels. Therefore the spiritual messages in Christianity are sidelined to focus on political action.
- It emphasises structural sin over personal sin. 
	- Jesus, however, reached into people's personal lives and spoke the the individual of coming back to God through forgiveness
- It places too much emphasis on people delivering liberation and salvation- ultimately the kingdom of God is brought by God's intervention and salvation is a gift from God


## Richard McBrien


It could be argued that liberation theology is so concerned about action that it has not paid sufficient attention to christian theology. In starting from action it cannot determine which actions might be right or wrong.

It also defines oppression in economic terms, ignoring other kinds of oppression- e.g. sexism and racism.

# Proponents


- for starving people, liberation from personal sin isn't the most important
- There isn't change happening for the people in our world who live in poverty- something must be done
- even if we agree that salvation and liberation is first about inner spiritual change, is there still not a point in which something must be done?


# Should Christianity engage with secularist atheist ideologies?


| Yes                                                                                                         | No                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *Christianity has always adapted to new insights and borrowing from Marxism will not corrupt the religion.* | Both theories have different approaches: Christianity is spiritual, Marxism is economic                                                                                        |
| *For example, scientific advancement has led to the reconsideration of the story of genesis.*               | Marxism explains how workers can liberate themselves by developing a socialist society                                                                                         |
| *It has also led us to reconsider the healing stories in the new testament*                                 | Christianity puts forward the idea of a world created by a loving God. Humans turn away from God and God's response is to seek people to bring back to him by sending his son. |
| *God can be encountered in all things- including human thought: making "christian Marxism" possible*        | If Christianity were to adopt elements of Marxism (which isn't in biblical cannon)- it would abandon the christian worldview                                                   |

**But even if Marxism and Christianity can be compatible, perhaps we should not adopt it wholescale.**

- **Boff** thinks that liberation for Christians must draw from the Gospel and Marxism must not be a central principle. He says that Marxism focusses on a socialist system that denies God and individual dignities.
	- "Marx is a useful companion on the way, but there is only one teacher: Jesus Christ."
- Bonino thinks that the Marxist scheme cannot be taken as a dogma, but rather as a method which has to be applied to our own reality *in the terms* of our reality

## Gustavo Gutierrez (VIP)

- Gutierrez, a Peruvian priest, mentions Marx's theories of alienation and exploitation. Not surprisingly, he warned against adopting all of Marx's teachings. 
- Gutierrez did, however, feel that the people of Latin America had a deep rooted desire to get rid of capitalism. 
	- He felt that the Church should stand with political groups on this
- He felt that it is through '*praxis*' that the poor are helped and that true knowledge of God comes through living with and helping the poor

**Praxis**- the process by which a theory/lesson/skill is enacted, applied, realised, and/or *put into practice.*

- For Gutierrez, to not get involved is sinful because you are keeping the situation as it is. He feels that the church in Latin America has no choice but to speak out.
	- "Surely the unity of the church cannot tolerate class struggle. Surely the aim is a socialist society: more just and more human."
- However, theologian Miroslav Volf argued theology and theory has to come first. 


# Summary of my ideas

## Definitions

>Separating the definitions of violence into 'physical violence' (hitting someone, etc) and 'political violence' (having health insurance claims denied, refusing to give one's labour (in the form of strikes/refusal based on characteristics) which then leads to others suffering, etc)

### Marxism's main points of interest are:
1. **actions are what matter: changing society must be up to philosophers to not just interpret, but also act on their interpretations.**
2. Class as a system is used to oppress the poor on a systemic level
3. The only way to overcome this is through violent revolution
4. Post-revolution, there are directions/methods that he writes of for how the state should be run/exist
5. this society should be atheist
###### Liberation theology
- this is not one single, organised idea. The particulars tend to change based on philosophers- specifically on:
	- if violence is acceptable when doing this (only Restrepo is a proponent)
	- how far one should go with this (Pope John Paul II at the lower end, Gutierrez at the higher end.)

‘Liberation theology compromises Christian faith by aligning too closely with Marxism’

My main line of argument is that while liberation theology is certainly influenced by, or perhaps kickstarted by Marxism: they are fundamentally different ideologies: not even in the same category of ideology: Marxism is political methodology, meanwhile Liberation theology is an ethical idea. 

TLDR: it doesn't compromise christian faith because it does not align with Marxism. 

## Themes of my argument

| Theme                            | Point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Violence                         | Physical violence is not condoned by the Bible- and neither is it by the majority of Liberation theologians: because it is not in the Bible. However, *political* violence *is* condoned by both. (needs more research)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Politics                         | Some argue that the church shouldn't be involved in politics. This is a moronic idea- everything is inherently political. There is no such thing as not being political: even saying that oneself will not be political is political: because it means you will not stand in the way of injustices of others simply because it is convenient for you to ignore it. Also, saying that Jesus/the Bible wasn't political is fucking stupid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Political methodology            | Liberation theology's major difference with Marxism is that it does not illustrate methods of revolution- it simply points out that injustice is systemic and something must be done about that. It is more pointing out that the church should stand with those who fight against systemic injustice, rather than a methodology for how to overturn a state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Theology                         | Some argue that Christianity should be more focussed on prayer and theology. I don't particularly see where they got this from, because Jesus certainly didn't pray that much; he acted. Whether it was riding into Jerusalem on a donkey, flipping over tables at a bank, supporting the poor and oppressed through his actions. Any prayer he does do is accompanied by action. Why would Christians not act? All of Jesus' teachings are on how to act, not how to pray.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Preferential option for the poor | Some argue that we should not show specific preference for the rights of the poor; because salvation comes to everyone. This is ignorant of the fact that wealth is used as a tool against the oppressed of all kinds so that they stay oppressed in a systemic manner. Women weren't allowed bank accounts until the 60's, pink tax, racist bias in hiring (meaning that people of colour can't get higher paying jobs), the american government not providing financial aid during the HIV/AIDS pandemic (because it was contracted by mostly homosexuals)- things like this meant to keep oppressed groups oppressed. This is also known as political violence.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Systemic sin v individual sin    | Some argue that Jesus focussed more on individual sin rather than the sins that are systemic: so therefore we should do that too. This ignores the fact that Jesus lived in a time where political theory (such as the one of systemic injustice) was not widespread knowledge- and also in a time where life was incredibly different; 95% of the population were farmers or in some other manual labour; stocks didn't exist; rent didn't exist; globalism didn't exist; people only knew people who lived nearby, etc. Systemic injustice was (while still absolutely a big thing at the time) not as widespread or as inescapable as it is today. To pretend like one shouldn't adapt to the times is moronic. Also; Jesus was intended to become *king*- which absolutely would not have been dealing with sin on an individual level! |
