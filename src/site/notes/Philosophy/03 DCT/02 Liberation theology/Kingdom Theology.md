# Two cities

We have the city of man, and the city of God- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Augustinian</span> concepts. 

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"><b>The city of man</b></span> is those who love themselves and hate God. It's inherently sinful, and doomed to failure.

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"><b>The city of God</b></span> is those who love God and forsake themselves.

> For Augustine, politics is only in the city of man; which is imperfect. We should always aim to be members of the city of God/not involved in politics. 

## Augustine's opinions

> Because of this, he thinks that one should not interact with politics at all, because it is only in the city of man; <span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)">which is sinful. </span>
> The city of man is doomed to fail.
- He believes that we can only do good through God's grace and acting as God's will on Earth. 

*This is useful for Bonhoeffer, who arguably interacted a lot with both the cities of man and God.*

## The Kingdom of God

In Christianity, the kingdom of God is one of Jesus' central but most debated ideas. It can mean God's rule over creation, or a meditative state, or just when one obeys the law of God.

Some believe that the kingdom of God is a meditative state.

### Different views of the Kingdom of God

## Mentions of the Kingdom of God in the Bible

> [!example] Mark- the kingdom is near/at hand
> "The time has come. The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!"


> [!example] Luke - the kingdom belongs to the poor
> "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the Kingdom of God"

- Note that there is another interpretation: "<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"><i><span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"><span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Blessed are the poor <b>in spirit...</span></b></i></span></span>" in Matthew.


> [!EXAMPLE] Luke - The kingdom is among you
> "The kingdom of God is not something that can be observed, because [it is] among you/within you."

This is a key text for<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> Augustinian</span> theology- that the Kingdom is an *inner reality.*
Liberation theologians reinterpret "<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">among you</span>" as *social presence*


> [!EXAMPLE] Matthew- the kingdom is both now and future
> "When the son go Man comes in his glory... he will say... '*I was hungry and you gave me something to eat.*'"

Saying that the final judgement is based on *practical acts of mercy.*
-> For LT, this passage<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> unites social justice</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">salvation</span>: the future kingdom is<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)"> judged by present action</span>
-> for<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)"> Augustine</span>, these are fruits of <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">grace within the elect</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">not</span> conditions for a <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">utopian society</span> on earth.

> "My Kingdom is not of this world."

### Boff

Note that he was a Latin american laypeople who were involved in the church (they weren't officiated, so they didn't have to follow orders.)

He was a Marxist.
