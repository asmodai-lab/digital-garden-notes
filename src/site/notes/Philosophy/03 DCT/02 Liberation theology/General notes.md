**"it is essential nor forget the reply of Jesus to the Tempter: "It is not on bread alone that man lives, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God"
"it is a fatal error to separate these two and even worse to put one before the other."_**

The main criticism of Liberation Theology is that it is too focussed on the Kingdom of Man and not the more spiritual aspects of Christianity. 

Liberation Theologians need to recognise that evil structures come from evil people, not the other way round. 

Gutierrez responded to critiques of LT not focussing on spiritual/ personal salvation by arguing that:
- "sin is not only an impediment to a break with God in the afterlife, but sin is also a historical reality." a breach of communion, individuals turning in on themselves. 
- Because sin is both personal and structural
- Sin is a social and historical fact, a breach of friendship with God
- Sin is most evident in oppressive structures
- Sin is both personal and collective.
- The work of Christ is a new creation, but he focusses on the structural dimension of sin. 
- We are the human beings that produce these sins, but for Boff, they don't talk much about moral sin/personal sin. They assume a notion of a baptized continent, original sin is eradicated from your life, so they don't preach conversion. 

Most Liberation Theologians are actually social democrats, not communists. Capitalism is inherently reliant on greed, and it rewards greed — if greed is down, then the economy and therefore society suffers. 

Capitalism is not interested in religion — it only matters that the system keeps working. 

The old testament is VERY interested in economics. It has many positive commandments. Hard work is valued (10-12 hours a day, 6 days a week working), but if people couldn't work, they were expected to be supplied for. They had checks and balances on someone being too greedy.

Liberation Theologians do not ask for an actual system, just one that will prioritize human flourishing. We need to pay much attention to our discourse — and how they still affect the majority of people. 

There is so much concentration of sin which separates you from God's law, from your neighbour. The structural dimension of salvation is necessary (see the freedom of the Jewish people in Egypt)- this was not from personal sin, but from structural sin. 

There are three main denominations of LT- the one working within the Church, the ones that are still Christian but not beholden to the Church, and the post-christian.

Need to emphasize both personal and structural sin- Gutierrez believes in both but he does not elaborate on it. 

Liberation theologians emphasize the kingdom of God as inaugurated — but they put the **now** over the **not yet.**

Pope Francis I's first papal letter (the joy of the gospel) was a thorough critique of capitalism. 'how is it news when the stock market lowers by 2 points, but not when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure.' he also said 'this kind of economic system kills'

Ratzinger did not critique LT to justify not helping the poor. He explicitly said that it must not be taken as approval of 'those who keep the poor in misery, who profit from their misery, who notice it and do nothing about it, and those who are indifferent'.
	 'the church, guided by the gospel of mercy and love for mankind hears the cry of justice, and intends to respond with all it's might
