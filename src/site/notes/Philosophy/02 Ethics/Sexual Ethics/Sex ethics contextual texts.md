#### Guiding questions

1. Why is erotic celebration shocking in scripture?
>Because this is explicitly from the woman's perspective (although in the whole story, it switches back and forth, but still!) and talking about sexual pleasure and sexual acts, with little mention of doing this for pregnancy. The focus on the woman's pleasure here —and the fact that these people are clearly having sex *because* they love each other — is revolutionary.
2. Does this text support a positive theology of sex — or is it still symbolic?
>It's quite explicit. I'd have a hard time imagining how this is symbolic. You can't really symbolically suck someone's dick.
3. How might Song of Songs challenge Augustine or Kant
>For Augustine, it's explicit sexual joy without need of procreation — sex for the sake of sex — which completely challenges his worldview. It's a touch more complicated for Kant, because he comes at it from an ethical perspective, but given how these two people clearly aren't just using each other as means to an end, I think Kant would be fine with it.

### Augustine: concupiscence and the shadow of lust
#### Text
>“(I) ran wild in the shadowy jungle of erotic adventures.”

>“Clouds of muddy carnal concupiscence filled the air; the bubbling impulses of puberty befogged and obscured my heart; I could not tell the difference between lust and love.”

##### Analysis

- For Augustine,<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> sexual desire is tainted</span> not because bodies are bad, but<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> because </span>the<span style="color:rgb(172, 94, 232)"> will is damaged</span>.

###### Guiding questions
1. What is Augustine actually afraid of? Loss of reason? Misusing love? Disordered desire?
>He is afraid of loss of control to his own desires, which are — according to him — inherently sinful after the Fall. Falling prey to his own desires undermines his relationship with God
2. Does Augustine's pessimism about lust undermine the possibility of positive Christian sexual ethics?
>Abso-fucking-lutely.
3. How does concupiscence explain Christian teachings around chastity, celibacy, and marriage?
>since we are sinful because of the fall, especially around our desires for relationships (aka concupiscence), we must stay away from sex as much as possible so as to keep as close a relationship with God — however, marriage is safe because it is blessed by God, so one no longer needs to keep to chastity and celibacy. This is also why marriage is so important to Christians, because they want to fuck but can't unless they are married.

## Kant: sex, objectification, and the moral law
### The text

>“In loving from sexual inclination, they make the person into an object of their appetite. As soon as the person is possessed, and the appetite sated, they are thrown away, as one throws away a lemon after sucking the juice from it… Sexual desire drives us to ignore the humanity of our partners and to use them for our own purposes… Only monogamous marriage can make people formally committed to each other’s ends.”

#### Analysis
- Sex is morally dangerous because it objectifies and treats people as mere means, violating the Categorical Imperative.
- Kant believes sexual desire is so powerful that we will even consent to being treated as objects in exchange for our own gratification.
- Only lifelong, monogamous marriage can create a relationship where both partners are committed to treating the other as an end in themselves.
	- This is one of the most negative accounts of sex in Enlightenment philosophy.

##### Biographical gossip

- Kant was obsessively routine-driven; locals joked they could set their clocks by his afternoon walk.
- He wrote that sex is morally corrupting yet was rumoured (not proven) to have:
	- fathered an illegitimate child with a servant;
	- had an unusually close relationship with his house-maid;
	- lived with two bachelors known for libertine social lives in his youth.
- Historical gossip, yes — but useful for debate: does Kant’s personal life destabilise his abstract ethics?

#### Guiding questions

1. Is Kant right that sexual desire is inherently objectifying?
>This is false correlation. Just because sexual desire is often objectifying, does not mean that it is inherently objectifying.
2. Can consent prevent objectification, or is Kant correct that reciprocity isn’t enough?
>It's complicated. I objectification can't be retconned by the object consenting to being objectified.
3. Is marriage the only context where sexual desire becomes morally permissible?
>I think this is just Kant being a product of his time, not because he has actual reasoning behind this.
