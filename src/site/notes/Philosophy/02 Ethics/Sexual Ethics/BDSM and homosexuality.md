## Introduction

There is a landmark case called [[PDFs and articles/Criminalisation & Consent -- R. V. Brown\|R. V. Brown]] on if consensual acts are always morally justifiable.


> [!QUOTE]
> *"It is not clear to me that the activities of the appellants were exercises of rights in respect of private and family life. But assuming that the appellants are claiming to exercise those rights I do not consider that [Article 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_8_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights) of the European Convention on Human Rights invalidates a law which forbids violence which is intentionally harmful to body and mind. Society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence. Pleasure derived from the infliction of pain is an evil thing. Cruelty is uncivilised. I would answer the certified question in the negative and dismiss the appeals of the appellants against conviction."*

> [!QUOTE]
> "That proposition can be expressed as follows: an assault intended or which is likely to cause bodily harm, accompanied by indecency, is an offence irrespective of consent, provided that the injury is not 'transient or trifling'."

### Using ethical systems to examine BDSM

#### Natural moral law

#### Utilitarianism

From a utilitarian perspective, BDSM is okay when it produces more pleasure than harm. 
- this implies that all people involved are fully consenting, because a non-consenting person 'participating' in BDSM would produce more harm than pleasure. 
- This is a good example of a way to use the [[Philosophy/02 Ethics/Ethical systems/Utilitarianism#The utility monster critique\|utility monster critique]]

#### Situation ethics

#### Kantian ethics

The major thing to focus on here is the conditions of the **categorical imperative**

1. **Universalization of laws**
>Theoretically, yes, BDSM can be universalized. If one defines consent as:
>1. full knowledge of what will occur
>2. capable of rationalizing this (i.e. adults/non-animals)
>3. free from the pressure to agree or disagree
>4. free to withdraw consent without pressure at any time
>>Then you could definitely argue that — as long as all people involved have full consent — then yes, any BDSM act is perfectly fine.
>>> of course, one could argue that this allows for grievous/lasting bodily harm; however, I think anything with such lasting consequences is an event which is hard to have full knowledge/rationalise, then it still fits the definition
>Of course, you could argue that I am cherry picking — and that is a fair counter argument. However, I do think my definition can be applied universally, so I don't care.


2. means to an end
> Treating everyone as an end in themselves? Easy! As long as one respects their partner and is not having sex: a) entirely for their own sexual pleasure, **and** b) whilst treating their partner only as a means and not as an end (which would disrespect their consent — as if you are treating someone as a means you *don't care* if they consent) then any sexual act is fine. 
3. Kingdom of ends
4. legislating member
>This one is only for use in actually acting out Kant's principles. If you've heard of the prisoner's dilemma, then Kantian ethics demands that one chooses the most virtuous option, no matter if your opponent is guaranteed to choose the option which hurts you.

## Homosexuality

### introduction

It's likely that people at the time of the Bible thought about homosexuality in a completely different manner: the relationships between men and what was considered homosexuality wold have been completely different.

#### Key terms

> both of these words appear in the Bible, so it's important to know of them and their context.

>If you want more info, look at Ben Wardle's dissertation on Biblical Exegesis/Hermeneutics

##### terms for homosexuality

**Arsenokoitai**

- this can be translated as homosexual relations, **or** it could be referred to as exploitative/paedophilia relations. It's unclear what it means, although it is definitely sexual

**Malakoi**

- this literally translates to 'soft/fine' (as in fine clothing.) 
	- In the New Testament, it can be interpreted in various ways.
		- sometimes moral weakness
		- sometimes a form of effeminacy
		- some have argued that it's a passive partner in homosexual relations

##### Other terms

>[!info] **Exegesis**
>'to explain' or 'to interpret' — specifically/especially an interpretation of **the Bible.**

### Bible reading

Thousands of people have read/translated/transcribed/interpreted and used the Bible in countless ways
- the Bible is a major source of authority for some Christians. For Theonomous Christians, it is the only source of authority (*synoptic link to Christian Moral Principles.*)
We have fragments of Greek Bibles from the first 400 years and the Latin remains afterwards
>*Misquoting Jesus* by *Bart Ehrman* is good reading for this. There's a YouTube playlist of the podcast recordings [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uObu6PCipG0&list=PLmutpnyeVQcrRNOzPWdEothXcCVo2Npfv)

Theology goes through many changes. The current age of academic theology is **Postliberal Theology** — which accepts exegesis, demythologisation, and narrative theology

Different translations of the Bible have very different meanings; of which is often defined by the translator's own theology.
