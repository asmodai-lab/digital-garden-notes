## The six fundamental Principles

```exercise
1. Love is the $input{"only thing"} that is intrinsically good.
2. Love is the $input{"ruling"} norm in ethical decision making and $input{"replaces"} all laws
3. Love and $input{"justice"} are the same, love is $input{"justice"} distributed
4. Love wills the $input{"neighbours"} good, regardless of whether the $input{"neighbour"} is liked.
5. Only the $input{"end"} justifies the $input{"means"}
6. love decides on each situation as it arises, without $input{"laws"} to guide it
```
