## Principles of Kantian ethics

Note that chapters 9 and 10 (p.125-141) in [The Elements of Moral Philosophy](https://home.csulb.edu/~cwallis/382/readings/160/EM.pdf) are absolutely fantastic reading for discovering the nuances of Kant's arguments

| Duty                            | Kant believed that there was nothing good except good will. Nothing else matters: not the consequences of an action, not your emotions about an action, etc. We must be ethical because it is our duty to be ethical. <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | > This makes his theory **deontological and absolutist.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Reason                          | Acting by feelings will lead to inconsistent morality — especially when acting for/against specific people.<br><br>Acting teleologically is wrong because we do not know the effects our actions will have.<br>> Therefore we must always act with reason and with accordance of our duty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Teleologically is in accordance with purpose — telos=purpose.<br><br>Also see the article below — it is good reading for Kant. To understand how he would respond is to understand many of his ideas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| The categorical imperative      | 1. **Universal law**: a maxim must be able to be universalized. If you are not willing for anyone to do an action, you should not do it.<br>2. **Means to an end**: one must never treat a person as a means only, always as an end. People should never be used for the sake of others to support some abstract ideal.<br>3. **Kingdom of ends**: treat everyone as people for whom good must be done.<br>4. **Legislating member:** you have to imagine that you create the rules and everyone will follow them. | Note that the means to an end doesn't mean you can't use someone as a means — otherwise society wouldn't function. It's just that you must also treat them as an end at the same time.<br><br>For understanding Kant's 'legislating member principle', read [this article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prisoners-dilemma.asp) on the prisoner's dilemma. TLDR: Kant always picks the most virtuous option, no matter the opponent.<br> |
| the hypothetical imperative     | 'if you want to do well in your exams, you must study'. Hypothetical imperatives aren't on the same level as categorical imperatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | You shouldn't really mention these in exams: they don't matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Immortality and God             | Kant noted that in order for there to be a reason for us to do our duty, we must be rewarded for our actions.<br>>This is through the ***summum bonum*** the place where all our happiness and virtue come together.<br>>> This is not something achievable on earth — so it must be the afterlife.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | This argument is then how he argues for the existence of God: a being who can arbitrate this reward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Three postulates of pure reason | Kant said that there were three conditions on reality that are necessary for his theory to work.<br>1. We must have free will in order to make our own decisions<br>2. There must be an afterlife so that we can achieve the **summum bonum**<br>3. There must be a God in order for there to be a fair judge on who should achieve this.                                                                                                                                                                          | This is a moral argument for the existence of God                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
