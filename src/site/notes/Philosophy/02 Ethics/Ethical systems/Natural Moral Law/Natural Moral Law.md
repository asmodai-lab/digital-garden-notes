# Thomas Aquinas

## Objective morality
- Found in Aristotelian and Stoic ethical thought;
	- *"The law that is written on men's hearts."* -St. Paul
- Natural law appeals to the sense that certain things can be known — by anyone — to be right or wrong.
	- There is an <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">absolute</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">universal </span>good and evil.
	- This means that <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">eternal </span>and <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">universal justice</span> applies to everything.
	- It is <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">deontological</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">absolutist</span>

### Aquinas' four tiers of law
1. **Eternal law** — the mind or reasoning of God, only seen through natural law
2. **Divine law** — eternal law written down/shown in scriptures such as the Bible, allows us to use natural reason to access what is right or wrong.
3. **Natural law** — rational exercise of working out what is good for human flourishing; "right reason in accordance with human nature." Follows the direction of eternal law. 
4. **Human law** — human ability to interpret the Natural Law and set rules for society so that people can flourish. 

#### Phronesis 

> [!info] 
> Phronesis is practical reasoning, judgement and conscience. 

Aquinas rejected divine command theory — arguing that what God commands is right.
	 He believed that morality could be accessed through reason alone; morality rooted in reason, justified and developed in scripture.
Theoretical law is just intellect, whereas practical knowledge allows us to make the right decisions according to natural law, in order to achieve our telos and not be swayed by out passions.

Conscience guides us to act with reason.
	God gave us conscience in order to access natural law.
Virtuous habits also direct us towards good acts. 


> [! tip] Aquinas' thinking;
> REASON + VIRTUE + CONSCIENCE = PRACTICAL JUDGEMENT = DO GOOD AND AVOID EVIL = EUDAMONIA/PURPOSE
