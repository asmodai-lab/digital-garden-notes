> [!info] Principle of utility
> "The greatest good for the greatest number."

Utilitarianism has 3 major branches: Act, Rule, and the irrelevant one. They all agree on the principle of utility, but they disagree on how they define 'good', and therefore they disagree on how to achieve it. 

If you are going to use Utilitarianism in any essay, you are probably going to have to mention both, because they are quite different.

Our two philosophers for this are [[Philosophy/02 Ethics/Ethical systems/Utilitarianism#Jeremy Bentham\|Bentham]] and [[Philosophy/02 Ethics/Ethical systems/Utilitarianism#John Stuart Mill\|J.S. Mill]] 


## Philosopher's backgrounds
### Jeremy Bentham

Bentham campaigned for legal and social reform in the late 1700s to early 1800s — specifically on slavery and women's rights. He came up with the principle of utility and the hedonistic calculus. 

He believed that humans are psychological hedonists:
- i.e. we always seek our own pleasure

### John Stuart Mill

J.S. Mill was a liberal politician and social philosopher. He posited that all knowledge is based on experiences, and desires/beliefs are products of psychological laws. 
- for him, ethics was based on the desire of humans to be happy.


## Act utilitarianism

This was Bentham's utilitarianism.
- it's teleological 🡺 whatever will bring about the most good

He had to define what good was. Because Bentham was a hedonist, he believed that pleasure=good/happiness
- for him, the two are interchangeable.

### The hedonic calculus

He then creates the hedonic calculus to determine how good an act is.

It uses various variables:
1. intensity
2. duration
3. certainty
4. propinquity (how soon)
5. fecundity (follow-on pleasure)
6. purity of pleasure
7. extent

### Strengths and weaknesses of Act

## Rule utilitarianism

Mill disagreed with hedonism — he thought good is something other than pleasure.
- he reformulated utilitarianism to reflect that **good =/= pleasure**, and that pleasures aren't all of equal value

He introduced the **theory of utility** — which replaced pleasure for happiness. 
>He defined happiness as something which is cultural and spiritual, and not just physical
>>He also distinguished between lower and higher pleasures. 

### Higher and lower pleasures

He took a qualitative approach compared to Bentham's more quantitative approach.

He divided pleasures into higher and lower
- higher pleasures were things such as poetry and music
- lower pleasures were things such as eating and drinking

> [!QUOTE]
> *"it is better to be a human satisfied than a pig dissatisfied."*

> His line of thought was similar to **Epicureans**: a group of intellectuals that thought mental pleasure > bodily pleasure

#### Rules

Note that Mill used the principle of utility not for individual situations, but to come up with rules for all of society: which are then followed. Mill is using the principle of utility as a method for discovering the best way of government: essentially just setting the goal as the principle of utility.

### Strengths and weaknesses of Rule

| Less relative: we won't have extremists doing things because their perception of pleasure is different to ours | Decides which is higher and which is lower pleasures, when that is relative                                                        |
| higher pleasures do enrich life more than lower quality pleasures                                              | Elitist: higher pleasures favour intellectuals: which is historically the upper class.                                             |
| always know if you are being moral because it is deontological                                                 | Rule fetishism: prevents us from considering our actions because we just accept the rules- regardless of complexity of situations. |

| A system which aims to create greater happiness for individuals/groups is attractive: and provides a simple aim to work for and unite around.<br>> This is the basis of liberalism: which was absolutely revolutionary at the time of it's creation | It's teleological 🡺 but we don't always know what will happen from an action.           |
