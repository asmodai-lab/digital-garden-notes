> [!info] Principle of utility
> "The greatest good for the greatest number."

Utilitarianism has 3 major branches: Act, Rule, and the irrelevant one. They all agree on the principle of utility, but they disagree on how they define 'good', and therefore they disagree on how to achieve it. 

If you are going to use Utilitarianism in any essay, you are probably going to have to mention both, because they are quite different.

Our two philosophers for this are [[Philosophy/02 Ethics/Ethical systems/Utilitarianism#Jeremy Bentham\|Bentham]] and [[Philosophy/02 Ethics/Ethical systems/Utilitarianism#John Stuart Mill\|J.S. Mill]] 


## Philosopher's backgrounds
### Jeremy Bentham

Bentham campaigned for legal and social reform in the late 1700s to early 1800s — specifically on slavery and women's rights. He came up with the principle of utility and the hedonistic calculus. 

He believed that humans are psychological hedonists:
- i.e. we always seek our own pleasure

### John Stuart Mill

J.S. Mill was a liberal politician and social philosopher. He posited that all knowledge is based on experiences, and desires/beliefs are products of psychological laws. 
- for him, ethics was based on the desire of humans to be happy.
- He also came up with the harm principle. This comes from his liberal ideas: it is that as long as one isn't doing harm,


## Act utilitarianism

This was Bentham's utilitarianism.
- it's teleological 🡺 whatever will bring about the most good

He had to define what good was. Because Bentham was a hedonist, he believed that pleasure=good/happiness
- for him, the two are interchangeable.

### The hedonic calculus

He then creates the hedonic calculus to determine how good an act is.

It uses various variables:
1. intensity
2. duration
3. certainty
4. propinquity (how soon)
5. fecundity (follow-on pleasure)
6. purity of pleasure
7. extent

#### The utility monster critique

This is directly copied from [this web article](https://thecougarstar.com/1819/opinion/the-utility-monster-a-critique-on-utilitarianism/) by Jiajia Huang on the utility monster critique.

> The Utility Monster theory is a hypothetical situation involving a hypothetical being called the Utility Monster and some cookies. From consuming each cookie, the Utility Monster produces much more “happiness” than the average person, thus being able to provide more happiness to the populace than the average person. So, following the tenets of utilitarianism, one would give the Utility Monster more cookies than the rest of the humans to produce the greatest output of happiness. 
> 
> However, the amount of cookies —a metaphor for human resources in this problem— is limited, which means that if the Utility Monster were to receive more cookies, cookies would have to be taken away from everyone else; thus reducing the happiness output of others. 
> 
> This is obviously unfair as there is an imbalance between the cookies being doled out to the Utility Monster and any other person. Despite this act of unfairness, giving more cookies to the Utility Monster would still produce the greatest amount of utility for the populace and net happiness would be maximized. Still, others would lack resources —or in this case, cookies— and would have to suffer in exchange for greater net happiness. In order to increase net happiness, more people would have to suffer.
> 
> This is a drawback of utilitarianism. This philosophy of maximized happiness and utility will always be subject to those “utility monsters.” This raises the question, is net happiness and utility representative of true happiness and utility? You could say that a group’s utility is directly correlated to the utility of the least happiest person in said group.
> 
> But what is happiness and how can it be measured? _Can_ it even be measured in the first place? Happiness varies from person to person and there is no concrete way to quantify the amount of happiness in an individual or a group. 
> 
> This is why utilitarianism does not work as either a concept or a method of action. Utilitarianism centers around the maximization of happiness, something that can’t be properly measured and has no concrete unit. Furthermore, utilitarianism even goes so far as to contradict its own philosophy as seen with the example of the Utility Monster.

## Rule utilitarianism

Mill disagreed with hedonism — he thought good is something other than pleasure.
- he reformulated utilitarianism to reflect that **good =/= pleasure**, and that pleasures aren't all of equal value

He introduced the **theory of utility** — which replaced pleasure for happiness. 
>He defined happiness as something which is cultural and spiritual, and not just physical
>>He also distinguished between lower and higher pleasures. 

### Higher and lower pleasures

He took a qualitative approach compared to Bentham's more quantitative approach.

He divided pleasures into higher and lower
- higher pleasures were things such as poetry and music
- lower pleasures were things such as eating and drinking

> [!QUOTE]
> *"it is better to be a human satisfied than a pig dissatisfied."*

> His line of thought was similar to **Epicureans**: a group of intellectuals that thought mental pleasure > bodily pleasure

#### Rules

Note that Mill used the principle of utility not for individual situations, but to come up with rules for all of society: which are then followed. Mill is using the principle of utility as a method for discovering the best way of government: essentially just setting the goal as the principle of utility.
