| 16 year-olds are irresponsible. They aren't allowed to get married, buy alcohol or cigarettes, or leave school.                                                                                                   | That doesn't mean that they don't deserve a say in society. Also, they can join the army, have sex, and pay taxes. also, imposing adult responsibilities is not a right (bull)                                                  | Ultimately, it is true that teens cannot exercise full adult responsibility. This, however, is unrelated to if they should have the right to vote.             |
| 16-year-olds will end up just voting as an extension of their parents- which means the groups in society who have kids will be overrepresented in the electorate.                                                 | Voting is secret. While yes, many will vote as an extension of their parents- so do many people vote as an extension of their family/friends. Nobody can be coerced into voting in a certain manner. Also, citizenship lessons. | Just because one will vote irresponsibly, does not take away the fact they should have the right to vote. Even shitheads deserve rights.                       |
| 16-year-olds can pay taxes- many have part-time jobs, and that means they contribute to society- therefore, they should have a say in how their money is being spent.                                             | Paying taxes is not a precursor to voting. Also, most 16-year-olds don't earn enough money to pay taxes anyway. This doesn't apply to the majority.                                                                             | The fact that some do- even a minority- is enough. Plus- some adults don't pay taxes, and they can vote. Why not 16-year-olds?                                 |
| teens don't have the necessary life experience to make proper decisions.            Voter turnout amongst 18-24s is typically under 50%. Also, 18s are significantly more likely to be active members of society. | The same could be said for 18s, though.   Policy decisions now will affect teens much more than adults- like the environment. They should have a say in their future.                                                           | Just because turnout is low, and that will decrease legitimacy- does not mean that they don't deserve the right to vote. Remember: even shitheads have rights. |
| There isn't only one way (voting) to be involved in politics. Joining a pressure group or political party, signing a petition, or contacting your local MP are actions that all are capable of.                   | This doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to vote.                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                |
