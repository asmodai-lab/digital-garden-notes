| ==the amendment process is shite which doesn't allow for changing with the times- living constitutionalism allows it to keep up== | it's shite for a reason- no populism here babey                                                                  |

| populism is inevitable in politics- but the judges aren't subject to populism anyway via the appointment process                  |                                                                                                                  |
