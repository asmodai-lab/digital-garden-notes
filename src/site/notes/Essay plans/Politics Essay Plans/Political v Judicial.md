| The appointment process is inherently political since the nominees are from the sitting President- who appoints judges based on ideology. This is clear in that Trump appointed three justices and the SC swung right in it's decision making.                                                                                                                      | Political pressure             | The position is designed to be independent- as judges are appointed for life and not obviously venerable to political pressure. The current SC has voted against Trump multiple times (ordering the release of federal aid, ordering troops to withdraw from Chicago.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | While judges don't face political pressure, this doesn't mean that they cannot choose to be political.                                                                                                                                                     |
| The SC has been more political in the last half-decade: overturning Roe v. Wade with Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health, or the many cases ruled in Trump's favour (Trump v CASA/United States/Hawaii), or in United states v. Skremetti, upholding Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors. They have clearly chosen to be more political in recent years. | Ideologies                     | Judges practice judicial restraint, and choose not to interfere in political matters. This is clear in ~50% of decisions being *per curiam* or 8-1, which wouldn't be expected if the judges were acting politically. They often use *stare decisis* or judge based on precedent- such as in Bostock v Clayton County: extending civil rights protections to Queer employees based on the Civil Rights Act- or in June Medical services v. Russo (2020)- which struck down an anti-abortion Louisiana law. | If this was 2015, it could be argued that the SC do practice Judicial Restraint. However, they have clearly become more political in recent years- going so far as Justice Clarence Thomas signalling that they would re-look over Obergefell v Hodges.    |
| Because they directly affect other branches, it's impossible for them not to be political. Either ruling on Trump v. United States would have unavoidably and significantly affected the relationship between the white house and congress- which are inherently political branches.                                                                                | Relationships between branches | The SC rules only on the constitution, and any affect they have on the branches of government is coincidental. They make decisions not based on public opinion- such as in Admissions v Harvard (2023), in which their ruling was very unpopular. Or in California v Texas, which upheld Obamacare, despite it being a right-leaning court.                                                                                                                                                                | While one can point to exceptions upon exceptions of the SC being unbiased, the reality is that the court is inherently political, no matter the leaning, because it affects political institutions. This is unavoidable, no matter how partisan they are. |
