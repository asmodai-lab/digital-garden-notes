| Voter choice and democracy        | Voters are given a choice of president rather than only the party doing it. Voters can choose from a range of competing policies and ideologies within a political party.                                                                                                                                          | Voting in different states on different dates means voters in earlier states have a much greater level of influence.  -unbound delagates are free to vote however they want, regardless of public opinion. | Overall, it's clear that primaries are a bad thing for voter choice and democracy- because although they can vote for their president, in reality very few Americans will be able to affect the choice of candidate properly, because of primaries taking place on different days. |
| voter education and participation | Throughout the primaries, issues with the candidate get aired. This means that the strongest candidate wins, and then has better chance of winning the election. - People develop better awareness of policies and issues. Then, because people are more aware, they are more likely to vote and vote effectively. | Closed primaries restrict participation. Voting in different states on different dates means voters in late states are often left unable to vote.                                                          | Overall, it's clear that primaries are a good thing for voter education and participation, because it directly involves them in the process and brings it to state-wide attention- and the higher awareness means that people are more likely to vote, increasing participation.   |
| benefit for parties               | primaries put candidates to the test in real elections. This helps the party select a candidate with the proven ability to win elections. Personal issues and political concerns can be dealt with during this time.                                                                                               | The eventual winner might be politically damaged by the process. Primaries do damage to a party by exposing infighting.                                                                                    | Overall, it's clear that primaries benefit parties- because it brings their policies and personalities to national attention- and the winner does have a proven ability to persuade people to vote for them.                                                                       |

In conclusion, primaries play a <font color="#00b050">negative role</font> in US democracy to a <font color="#00b050">small extent</font>- because although it benefits parties by making sure their candidate is<font color="#00b050"> strong on the national stage</font>, and it<font color="#00b050"> increases the political awareness </font>in the general public- ultimately these don't matter in the face of the <font color="#00b050">unfairness in the process</font>. Having increased awareness or a better candidate does not matter if the later states have <font color="#00b050">significantly less say</font> in the candidate- sometimes even being<font color="#00b050"> functionally worthless</font> if the candidate becomes presumptive before the later states have even voted. 
## Various evidence

o In the 2024 Republican primaries prominent candidates<font color="#8064a2"> Ron DeSantis</font> and <font color="#8064a2">Vivek Ramaswamy dropped out after Iowa</font>, the first state to vote. <font color="#8064a2">DeSantis</font>, one of the favourites to win the whole primary process, dropped out after coming second to Trump. Voters in Iowa had greater levels of choice (four candidates) than voters in later states who only had a choice of <font color="#8064a2">Trump</font> and moderate<font color="#8064a2"> Republican Nikki Haley.</font> This political inequality contradicts the basic principles of democracy.

o In 2016 the Republican establishment would almost certainly have chosen an established insider such as <font color="#8064a2">Ted Cruz </font>or <font color="#8064a2">Jeb Bush</font>. The primaries instead led to a clear winner in Trump who was arguably better equipped to win the presidency for the Republicans than either of the former candidates. The primaries quickly showed that whilst <font color="#8064a2">Bush</font> has huge fund-raising capacity he lacked resonance with voters.

o Whilst <font color="#8064a2">Bush</font> defeated<font color="#8064a2"> McCain</font> in a closely fought primary race in <font color="#8064a2">2000</font>,<font color="#8064a2"> McCain</font>'s policy of campaign finance reform gained attention and popularity and was<font color="#00b050"> passed into law.</font>
