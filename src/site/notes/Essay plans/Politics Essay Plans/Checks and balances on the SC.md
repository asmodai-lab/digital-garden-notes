#debates 
The extent and effectiveness of checks and balances both on and from the Supreme court.

This can be broken down into several question areas:
1. Effectiveness of checks and balances **on** the Supreme court
2. Effectiveness of checks and balances **from** the Supreme court
3. Overall power of the Supreme court.

| Several times the Supreme court has upheld habeas corpus for immigrants, directly- such as in Boumediene v Bush, or the two v Rumsfeld cases.                                                                             | Enforcement       | The deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia in 2025 was ruled against *per curiam* and ordered that he be brought back. This was completely ignored by the Trump administration. They have also ignored orders not to send troops to Chicago. | While the courts used to support habeas corpus and rights for immigrants, in more recent years these have been ignored by the Trump administration- demonstrating that the SC has very little power to enforce it's decisions.                                                             |
| Bostock v Clayton county (2020)- or the upholding of the ACA, or Trump v Casa Inc. (First- upholds rights, second and third uphold government actions. )                                                                  | Federalism        | Overall upholds federalism on more minor laws.  such as Dobbs v Jackson, United States v Skremetti, and Rucho v Common cause, and Murphy v NCAA.                                                                                          | While the court has had some major rulings that directly create/uphold policy nationwide, these examples are generally rare, and mostly limited to constitutional rights. On anything not in the constitution, the SC almost always gives power to the states.                             |
| The court's independence means it is functionally immune to political pressure. The SC has gone against Trump many times- such as ordering that $2 billion in foreign aid be unfrozen, or Bostock v Clayton county (2020) | Politicisation    | The conservative balance of the court has clearly led to more decisions in Trump's favour, making it weaker in its partisanship. For example- Trump v CASA inc., Trump v Hawaii, and Trump v United States all being ruled in his favour. | While the SC can go against Trump, it often doesn't. Of course, this can change after justices retire/die, but this will take a while, and will have a strong affect on american politics for at least 2 decades being a republican SC majority.                                           |
| The court's decisions tend to be based on legal principles (Dobbs v Jackson) rather than politics. Also, ~50% of decisions are 9-0 or 8-1, despite the political split.                                                   | Judicial activism | The court shows willingness to interfere in controversial political areas, such as in United states v. Skrmetti, claiming it was a matter of state authority despite claims that it went against equal protection rights.                 | Overall, if judicial activism was more prevalent, one would expect less court decisions to be per curiam or close to. However, recent events- such as Justice Clarence Thomas' signalling to revisit Obergefell v Hodges, demonstrates that these judges are more political than previous. |
