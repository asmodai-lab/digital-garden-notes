| Polls can create a bandwagon effect. For instance, in the 2019 GE, polls predicting a significant Tory lead may have convinced undecided voters to back them, or convinced opposed voters to not vote, convinced a Tory victory was inevitable.                        | Many voters make decisions based on things other than polls. The 'Red Wall' shift in 2019 was caused by long-term dissatisfaction with Labour's stance on Brexit and economic policies.                                                                                              |
| Media coverage amplifies poll's importance — take Reform's current showing in the polls and showing in Media.                                                                                                                                                          | Polls are only paid attention to by those who follow politics and elections closely. For instance, polls in 2024 showing shifts in younger voter turnout became focal on social media — and young voter turnout dropped from ~<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">47%->~37%.</span> |
| Polls can mobilise voters who fear that their preferred party is trailing. For example, in the 2019 GE, polling data suggested a possible hung parliament, potentially motivating Tory voters to turn out.                                                             | The majority of voters have a preference before campaigns begin, so polls have little impact. In 2019, Scotland continued to back the SNP despite polling trends.                                                                                                                    |
| Strategic voting can be influenced by polls, especially in marginal constituencies. For example, in the 2024 GE, polling data highlighted tight races in the South East, leading calls for Lib-Dem voters to vote for Labour in key constituencies to unseat Tory MPs. | Inaccurate or poorly conducted polls can be misleading. In 2024, a widely shared (but flawed) poll underestimated Labour's performance in the Midlands, creating false expectations of a conservative hold in marginal seats.                                                        |
