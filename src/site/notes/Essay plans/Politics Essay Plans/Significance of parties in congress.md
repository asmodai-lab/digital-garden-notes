Examine the extent to which political parties are significant in congress.

Conclusion:

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Overall, parties have a significant effect on Congress because of member's reliance on parties to get elected due to an overwhelming amount of 'safe seats', meaning most must follow party leadership and decisions in order to keep their seats. This is supported by the unitary nature of the parties — which demonstrates that members will vote on party lines, especially when necessary, such as in both of Trump's impeachment charge votes. In the face of this, any individual member's power — whilst significant — cannot compare in the face of a unitary party, of which is necessary to pass legislation in the partisan american political system. </span>

| Party disciple is still evident. Despite overwhelming pressure to release the Epstein files, only 4 republicans defected. A large number of 'Never Trumpers' Republicans fell in line with Trump policies — such as tax cuts.                                                                                                          | Unity                | Internal factionalisation means that party unity is weakened. After the Jan 6th riots, 10 House Republicans voted to impeach Trump. Some Republicans have voted for the release of the Epstein files — or been publically against Trump (MTG)                                                                         | <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Parties are incredibly unitary on controversial issues — such as on Trump's impeachment charges in 2019 and 2021, party lines were largely adhered to, demonstrating that on more controversial issues, parties will be unitary and so will have more effect.</span>                                                                                                                 |
| One member voting against a legislative agenda won't work: it's necessary for parties to vote in unison to block or pass bills because of the often close majorities in house and senate.                                                                                                                                              | Individual power     | Individual members can have more power. Senator Joe Manchin had a pivotal role in the Biden agenda, such as blocking parts of the Build Back Better plan in 2021.                                                                                                                                                     | <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">While individual members often don't have power, the existence of the few that do and their power in shaping agenda and law demonstrates that an individual's power matters more than the party.</span>                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Parties still play a crucial role in candidate success. Most seats are safe seats for one party — that there are only 7 swing states in the USA, the rest are 'safe seats' and very rarely change, demonstrating that party loyalty is more important than candidate's qualifications. In 2024, only 17/435 house seats flipped party. | Loyalty in elections | Party loyalties are weak because of the constitutional separation of powers, and Parties don't provide many resources insofar as fighting campaigns, or finances. Many political adverts don't even mention the name of the candidate's party at all. Many news stations focus on individuals — like AOC or Mamdani.  | <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">While candidates do campaign on individual platforms, the existence of safe seats demonstrates that people in elections mostly vote on party lines, not on if they like the candidate. Take Gavin Newsome, the Democratic governor of California, who before 2025 was incredibly unpopular within California but still was governor.</span>                                          |
| The President still has incredible power of persuasion — many of Trump's endorsements in 2022 largely secured nomination due to his influence. The ability of the President to endorse or attack candidates overrides any local importance.                                                                                            | Local politics       | Politics is often local. Congress members have a much deeper connection to their constituencies because they don't rely on party affiliation to get elected — congress members are more aware of how their constituents will react to their voting record (which is made very public) than the leader of their party. | <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Senators are more likely to have their voting record get more attention, but they are only elected every 6 years — which leaves a long time for constituents to forget individual votes. However, many Republican senators have fallen in line with Trump despite not agreeing with him, partly due to Trump's popularity, especially in their own Republican constituencies.</span> |
