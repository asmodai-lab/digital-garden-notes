| Point                                                                                                                                              | Counter-point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Evaluation |

| Voting is a civic duty- in the same way that jury duty is a civic duty.                                                                            | Jury duty may be a civic duty, but we still acknowledge that some cannot participate- i.e. being at university                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |            |
| If the government forces the public to vote, that is coercion.                                                                                     | The government forces people to do shit all the fucking time. Also, just have a 'none of the above' option- see Belgium: turnout over 88% in the last 12 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |            |
| Low turnout decreases the legitimacy of every election. Turnout has been decreasing since fucking forever                                          | Legitimacy decreases anyway is the ballot gets spoiled, or if politically illiterate people make random decisions. It's not a mandate if people were forced to vote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |            |
| Some people are not well educated. "All voices should be heard", well what happens when those voices don't want to be heard?                       | If you don't plan to vote, your voice doesn't get a say. Polls say that political participation is highest among the upper classes and anyone above the age of 25. The voices that are heard aren't equal and so politicians target those who are most likely to vote- so not young people. If we want things to get better, we want to force politicians to truly represent *everyone* |            |
| Mandatory voting encourages political awareness                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |            |
| Mandatory voting increases turnout among underrepresented groups- such as the youth, POC, and the working class.                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |            |
| How do you enforce compulsory voting? Through fines- which is an inherent disadvantage to the poorest: who may not be able to afford to skip work. | Paid time off exists. Plus, if the government wants compulsory voting, they can fund it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |            |
