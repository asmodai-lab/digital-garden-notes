| If the Kingdom of God is only in the city of God, then liberation theology is misunderstanding it, because it acts in the city of man | Cities of God and man | Where is this justification for the city of God/man? Jesus acted in the city of man; why shouldn't we? | There is only one example of the Bible separating the city of man and God- 'My kingdom is not of this world.' That, however, does not discourage the idea that we should act on Earth in the image of Christ, just that heaven is above/better than Earth. |

Some argue that Liberation theology misunderstands the Kingdom of God by misunderstanding the separation of the cities of man and God. A weak point in support of this is proposed by Augustine: that since the city of man is inherently sinful and doomed to fail, we should not involve ourselves with it- i.e. in acting in a political manner and being involved in the state, Liberation Theology is acting in an un-christian manner. A stronger point against this is that Augustine's views have no basis in the Bible. Jesus himself acted in such a way that would fit Augustine's own definition of acting in the city of man- he was an inherently political figure who not only did political acts, but encouraged those around him to do so: by spreading his message ("Have you heard the good news/gospel?") and behaviours. To say that Christians should not be involved in the city of man is a viewpoint with no basis in the Bible- to go so far as the evidence going against the ideas of the separation of the city of man and God. Overall, Liberation Theology does not misunderstand the Kingdom of God as Augustine would argue- because Augustine's viewpoint that one should not act politically is an idea that is entirely his own, with basis in the Bible that disproves his own views- and so it cannot be a successful argument for Liberation Theology misunderstanding Christianity.
