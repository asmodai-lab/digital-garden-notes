Critically analyse God as timeless and eternal (atemporal)


| God is Atemporal                                                                                                                                                                                 | God isn't                                                                                                                     | Theme          | Evaluation                                              |

| God has to be atemporal because 'the gnawing of time bites all' (Wolterstorff): time changes us. God cannot change, therefore God must be timeless.                                              | If God is timeless, then how can he interact with the world, and be personal? Surely he wouldn't be immanent in this case?    | Calvin/Aquinas | ALL OF THESE ARGUMENTS FUCKING SUCK ARE YOU KIDDING ME? |
| God has to be atemporal otherwise he is not omnipotent, but humans must also have free will- so God is in the 'eternal present'- we just cannot understand it because of our feeble human minds. | This still doesn't solve the problem of God being impersonal. Boethius' argument only makes sense in a non-christian context. | Boethius       |                                                         |
| Inconsistent with omnipotence- God can't know something? So there is something that God can't do?                                                                                                | God must be within time in order to meddle in it. The future doesn't exist yet, so God can't know it.                         | Swinburne      |                                                         |

Bullet point ideas

- Swinburne's everlasting arguments (Wolterstorff)
- Calvinistic eternal
- Boethius' eternal
