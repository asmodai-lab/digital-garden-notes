## Speech (refined)

Ultimately, if Liberation theology aligned too closely with Marxism, it would compromise christian faith. However, it does not align too closely with Marxism. 

These two are fundamentally different ideas- even in their own definitions. Marxism is a political system, which expressed methods of overthrowing and then running a country. In comparison, Liberation Theology is just an ideology- an ethics system: but not one that is comprehensive or consistent across the people who propose it. Sure, it's core ideology: that society causes sin (aka structural sin) and that one must tackle these problems at the core is one taken from Marxism. But to say that these ideas are closely intertwined is ignorant. 

To pretend that LT is incredibly closely aligned with Marxism ignores the major proponents of LT. Both Boff and Gutierrez warn against adopting all of Marx's ideas- Boff says 'that marx is a useful companion on the way, but there is only one teacher; jesus christ.' 


The first point brought up by critics of Liberation theology is that the church should not be political. If you encounter anyone who brings up this point, you should first ask if they have read the Bible, and second if they have been living under a rock. 

Both Jesus Christ and the church have been and are political. It is fundamental to their nature- no matter how you think about politics. Jesus told the rich that, unlike the poor who were blessed, they would face woes. He criticised the King as a fox. He spoke harsh words to leaders of the nations when they were uncaring of the needy. He rode into Jerusalem on a donkey as a way of declaring himself king. The character of Jesus Christ is inescapably political. Just because he was never political as in involving himself in a political party, does not in any way mean that he wasn't political. 

Then, some may argue that the church itself shouldn't be political- because it has set precedent to do so. If you haven't already asked if the proponent has been living under a rock, please do so now.

The church has been political in England for a long, long time. 

The welfare system, (part of which you may know as the NHS- but containing most of the social care we know today) was set up by a man named William Beveridge, who was friends with the at the time Archbishop William Temple.

They reimagined post war Britain with the ideals of God in mind, and through that have saved and improved the lived of millions. 

If you want a more recent example- how about the previous Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby- who has explicitly written that the church should get involved in politics. In an article he wrote in 2018, he says:

"There will be great changes in our country through technology and science, through changes abroad and at home. We may base change in good values. We may just let things take their course.

But if it’s the latter, then the consequences for the poor, the sick and those on the margins will be dire. Our pride will be diminished, and our contribution to the world stifled."

So yes, the church should be and is political- and this idea, reminiscent of Liberation Theology (which comes from Marxism)- cannot be argued in any way shape or form to compromise christian faith.  

On the other hand, some have argued that Liberation theology compromises Christianity by being too closely aligned with action. Richard McBrien argues that liberation theology is so concerned about action that it has not paid sufficient attention to christian theology. In starting from action it cannot determine which actions might be right or wrong.

I.e. one should be more focussed on prayer than action. 

Again, one should ask any proponent of this question if they have read the bible, and if they say yes, ask if they a) are very sure, and b) did they do it with their eyes open? Does jesus spend the majority of his time praying? Does he? Really? I rest my case.

Then, some flip that and say that Liberation theology is too focussed on structural sin rather than individual sin- which is not in the path of Jesus. Kloppenburg argues that jesus reached into people's personal lives and spoke of the individual coming back to God through forgiveness- and that ultimately, it is only God that brings salvation.

This argument is, frankly, baffling. Jesus called for people to follow in his path, of kindness and uplifting the meek. To argue that because only God can bring large-scale salvation- we should not try and do that, is a lazy, evil viewpoint. To decide to not try and help people on a systemic scale because it will

'Laws are threats by the dominant socioeconomic power in any given region [...] the police are just an occupying army. '

**"When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist."** -Brazilian Archbishop Camara

Was it not political when Jesus rallied against the occupying romans? Was it not political 

Justin welby's article about being political because that is how we make a better world for our children. https://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/church-gets-involved-politics-because-thats-what-jesus-did

He was never party political. No wing of politics – left or right – can claim God as being on its side.

But Jesus was highly political. He told the rich that, unlike the poor who were blessed, they would face woes. He criticised the King as a fox. He spoke harsh words to leaders of the nations when they were uncaring of the needy. 

He did this because God cares for those in need and expects those who claim to act in his name to do the same. That means action - and words.

1942 Archbishop William Temple was old friends with William Beveridge, a top civil servant and another Christian, who wrote his great report that designed the welfare system, the health service and much of what we now take for granted in social care. They were friends with R.H. Tawney, a social philosopher, and again a Christian.

Drawing on Christian understandings of justice, generosity and human dignity, they described the kind of country that they felt reflected God’s values better.

There will be great changes in our country through technology and science, through changes abroad and at home. We may base change in good values. We may just let things take their course.

But if it’s the latter, then the consequences for the poor, the sick and those on the margins will be dire. Our pride will be diminished, and our contribution to the world stifled. 

If we all take part in forming our values, if we base them in what is good and precious in our heritage, then our future can be better than our past. Our children and grandchildren can remember us as a generation that gave them hope and purpose. 

For me, that is worth risking one’s head for. It justifies the church not only speaking about Jesus Christ, but also, like him, calling for – as well as working for – the society that God calls us to pursue.

## Structure

1. summary of my line of argument: Yes, if Liberation theology aligned too closely with Marxism, it would compromise christian faith, but in the manner it aligns in now it does not compromise christian faith, but complement it. 
2. Should the church even be political?
	1. Should the church focus on one individual group? Isn't that unfair? 
		1. What about spiritual poverty? 
3. Shouldn't the church focus on spirituality/theology rather than action? 
4. Structural sin
	1. Does structural sin exist? (yes)
	2. should the church tackle it?
	3. how does liberation theology suggest we tackle it? How does it differ from Marxism?
5. Violence
	1. Should the church be violent in it's aims to do liberation theology (no)
	2. however, political violence does not count
		1. and Jesus was politically violent. be honest with yourselves.
